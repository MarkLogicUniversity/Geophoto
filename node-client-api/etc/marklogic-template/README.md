# Template for API Documentation

This directory contains a template for generating JSDoc API docs
with gulp-jsdoc. The contents are derived from the bootswatch
"simplex" template, as generated by docstrap.

The original template was modified in the following ways:
* Minor color, font and other aethestic changes using the usual
  docstrap variables.
* Removed the @import of google fonts because they are not
  always reachable and can cause long page loads.
* Removed all embedded javascript so the pages can safely be hosted 
  by MarkLogic Server as XHTML. This meant trouncing on some of the
  configurable parts of the original setting. For example, you cannot
  enable Google analytics, despite what docstrap thinks.

To generate the docs using this template, run "gulp doc" from the
root project directory.

You can also use an alternative docstrap/bootswatch or a custom template
of your choosing. To use a different template:
* Edit gulpfile.js in the root project directory and change the "path"
  and "theme" values of the "doc" task.
* Run "gulp doc" from the root project directory. The docs are
  generated into a doc/ subdirectory.
