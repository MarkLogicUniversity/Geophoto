{"code":"ic","name":"Iceland","region":"Europe","background":"Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish) immigrants during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland boasts the world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the Althing, established in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Limited home rule from Denmark was granted in 1874 and complete independence attained in 1944. The second half of the 20th century saw substantial economic growth driven primarily by the fishing industry. The economy diversified greatly after the country joined the European Economic Area in 1994, but Iceland was especially hard hit by the global financial crisis in the years following 2008. Literacy, longevity, and social cohesion are first rate by world standards.","geo":{"Location":"Northern Europe, island between the Greenland Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, northwest of the United Kingdom","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":65,"min":0},"W":{"deg":18,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":103000,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":100250,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":2750,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Kentucky","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":4970,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"mostly plateau interspersed with mountain peaks, icefields;

Prior to the 2008 crisis, Iceland had achieved high growth, low unemployment, and a remarkably even distribution of income. The economy depends heavily on the fishing industry, which provides 40% of export earnings, more than 12% of GDP, and employs 7% of the work force. It remains sensitive to declining fish stocks as well as to fluctuations in world prices for its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon. Iceland's economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the last decade, particularly within the fields of software production, biotechnology, and tourism. Abundant geothermal and hydropower sources have attracted substantial foreign investment in the aluminum sector and boosted economic growth, although the financial crisis has put several investment projects on hold. Much of Iceland's economic growth in recent years came as the result of a boom in domestic demand following the rapid expansion of the country's financial sector. Domestic banks expanded aggressively in foreign markets, and consumers and businesses borrowed heavily in foreign currencies, following the privatization of the banking sector in the early 2000s. Worsening global financial conditions throughout 2008 resulted in a sharp depreciation of the krona vis-a-vis other major currencies. The foreign exposure of Icelandic banks, whose loans and other assets totaled more than 10 times the country's GDP, became unsustainable. Iceland's three largest banks collapsed in late 2008. The country secured over $10 billion in loans from the IMF and other countries to stabilize its currency and financial sector, and to back government guarantees for foreign deposits in Icelandic banks. GDP fell 6.8% in 2009, and unemployment peaked at 9.4% in February 2009. GDP fell 3.4% in 2010. Since the collapse of Iceland's financial sector, government economic priorities have included: stabilizing the krona, reducing Iceland's high budget deficit, containing inflation, restructuring the financial sector, and diversifying the economy. Three new banks were established to take over the domestic assets of the collapsed banks. Two of them have foreign majority ownership, while the State holds a majority of the shares of the third. British and Dutch authorities have pressed claims totaling over $5 billion against Iceland to compensate their citizens for losses suffered on deposits held in the failed Icelandic bank, Landsbanki Islands. Iceland agreed to new terms with the UK and the Netherlands to compensate British and Dutch depositors, but the agreement must first be approved by the Icelandic President. Iceland began accession negotiations with the EU in July 2010; however, public support has dropped substantially because of concern about losing control over fishing resources and in reaction to measures taken by Brussels during the ongoing Eurozone crisis.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":11820000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":12590000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-3.5% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":69.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":178800,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":22.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":73,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":28,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":12.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":4810000000},"expenditures":{"usd":5673000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":123.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":14.55,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":18.99,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4413000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":19970000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":46030000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1128000000},"Industrial production growth rate":"-1% (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":16840000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":16480000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":18900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1915,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":16390,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-42 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":4619000000},"Imports":{"usd":3677000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":4206000000.0000005},"Debt - external":{"usd":3073000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Icelandic kronur (ISK) per US dollar -","industries":["fish processing","aluminum smelting, ferrosilicon production","geothermal power, hydropower, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["potatoes","green vegetables","mutton","chicken","pork","beef","dairy products","fish"],"exportCommodities":["fish and fish products 40%","aluminum","animal products","ferrosilicon","diatomite"],"exportPartners":["Netherlands 30.71%","UK 12.73%","Germany 11.21%","Norway 5.75%","Spain 4.82%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","petroleum products","foodstuffs","textiles"],"importPartners":["Norway 12.97%","Netherlands 8.62%","Germany 8.3%","Sweden 8.03%","Denmark 7.27%","US 6.94%","China 4.98%","UK 4.55%","Brazil 4.09%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":185200,"Telephones - mobile cellular":349000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"telecommunications infrastructure is modern and fully digitized, with satellite-earth stations, fiber-optic cables, and an extensive broadband network","domestic":"liberalization of the telecommunications sector beginning in the late 1990s has led to increased competition especially in the mobile services segment of the market","international":"country code - 354;
