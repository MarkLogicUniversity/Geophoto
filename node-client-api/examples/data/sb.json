The economy has been declining, however, because of disputes with Canada over fishing quotas and a steady decline in the number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre. In 1992, an arbitration panel awarded the islands an exclusive economic zone of 12,348 sq km to settle a longstanding territorial dispute with Canada, although it represents only 25% of what France had sought. France heavily subsidizes the islands to the great betterment of living standards. The government hopes an expansion of tourism will boost economic prospects. Fish farming, crab fishing, and agriculture are being developed to diversify the local economy. Recent test drilling for oil may pave the way for development of the energy sector.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":48300000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":"$NA","GDP - real growth rate":"NA%","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":"NA%"},"Labor force":3450,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":41,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":41,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":10.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":70000000},"expenditures":{"usd":60000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":8.1,"unit":"%"},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":53000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":49290000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":563.6,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":5500000},"Imports":{"usd":68200000},"Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["fish processing and supply base for fishing fleets","tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["vegetables","poultry","cattle","sheep","pigs","fish"],"exportCommodities":["fish and fish products","soybeans","animal feed","mollusks and crustaceans","fox and mink pelts"],"importCommodities":["meat","clothing","fuel","electrical equipment","machinery","building materials"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":4800,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"adequate","domestic":"NA","international":"country code - 508; radiotelephone communication with most countries in the world; satellite earth station - 1 in French domestic satellite system"},"Broadcast media":"2 television stations with a third repeater station, all part of the French Overseas Network; has radio stations on St. Pierre and on Miquelon that are part of the French Overseas Network (2007)","Internet country code":".pm","Internet hosts":0},"transport":{"Airports":2,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":2,"1,524 to 2,437 m":1,"914 to 1,523 m":1},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":117,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":80,"unit":"km"},"unpaved":{"quantity":37,"unit":"km"}},"Ports and terminals":"Saint-Pierre"},"military":{"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":1064,"females age 16-49":1069},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":34,"female":32},"Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of France"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
