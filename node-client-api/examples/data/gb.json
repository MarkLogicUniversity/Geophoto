{"code":"gb","name":"Gabon","region":"Africa","background":"Until recently, only two autocratic presidents had ruled Gabon since its independence from France in 1960. The recent president of Gabon, El Hadj Omar BONGO Ondimba - one of the longest-serving heads of state in the world - had dominated the country's political scene for four decades. President BONGO introduced a nominal multiparty system and a new constitution in the early 1990s. However, allegations of electoral fraud during local elections in 2002-03 and the presidential elections in 2005 exposed the weaknesses of formal political structures in Gabon. President BONGO died in June 2009. New elections in August 2009 brought Ali Ben BONGO, son of the former president, to power. Despite political conditions, a small population, abundant natural resources, and considerable foreign support have helped make Gabon one of the more prosperous and stable African countries. In January 2010, Gabon assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2010-11 term.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the Atlantic Ocean at the Equator, between Republic of the Congo and Equatorial Guinea","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":1,"min":0},"E":{"deg":11,"min":45}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":267667,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":257667,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":10000,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Colorado","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":2551,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Cameroon 298 km, Republic of the Congo 1,903 km, Equatorial Guinea 350 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":885,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"narrow coastal plain;

Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s. The oil sector now accounts for more than 50% of GDP although the industry is in decline as fields pass their peak production. Gabon continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, and manganese exports and the global recession led to a GDP contraction of 1.4% in 2009. Despite the abundance of natural wealth, poor fiscal management hobbles the economy. In 1997, an IMF mission to Gabon criticized the government for overspending on off-budget items, overborrowing from the central bank, and slipping on its schedule for privatization and administrative reform. The rebound of oil prices from 1999 to 2008 helped growth, but drops in production have hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains. Gabon signed a 14-month Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF in May 2007, and later that year issued a $1 billion sovereign bond to buy back a sizable portion of its Paris Club debt.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":22480000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":13060000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":62.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":32.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":712000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":60,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":21,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":32.7,"unit":"%"}},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":28.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":3557000000},"expenditures":{"usd":2945000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":25.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"-1.3% (2010 est.)","Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1835000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2764000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1074000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4.8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1774000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":1446000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":241700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":14000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":227300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4185,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":2000000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":90000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":90000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":28320000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":591000000},"Exports":{"usd":6803000000},"Imports":{"usd":2433000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2602000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2374000000},"Exchange rates":"Cooperation Financiere en Afrique Centrale francs per US dollar -","industries":["petroleum extraction and refining","manganese, gold","chemicals, ship repair, food and beverages, textiles, lumbering and plywood, cement"],"agricultureProducts":["cocoa","coffee","sugar","palm oil","rubber","cattle","okoume (a tropical softwood)","fish"],"exportCommodities":["crude oil 70%","timber","manganese","uranium"],"exportPartners":["Russia 30.62%","US 16.56%","China 15.87%","France 4.28%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","foodstuffs","chemicals","construction materials"],"importPartners":["France 32.21%","US 7.92%","China 7.02%","Belgium 4.99%","Italy 4.81%","Cameroon 4.56%","Netherlands 4.35%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":26500,"Telephones - mobile cellular":1373000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"adequate system of cable, microwave radio relay, tropospheric scatter, radiotelephone communication stations, and a domestic satellite system with 12 earth stations","domestic":"a growing mobile-cellular network with multiple providers is making telephone service more widely available;
