{"code":"ls","name":"Liechtenstein","region":"Europe","background":"The Principality of Liechtenstein was established within the Holy Roman Empire in 1719. Occupied by both French and Russian troops during the Napoleonic wars, it became a sovereign state in 1806 and joined the Germanic Confederation in 1815. Liechtenstein became fully independent in 1866 when the Confederation dissolved. Until the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral), the country's low taxes have spurred outstanding economic growth. In 2000, shortcomings in banking regulatory oversight resulted in concerns about the use of financial institutions for money laundering. However, Liechtenstein implemented anti-money-laundering legislation and a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US that went into effect in 2003.","geo":{"Location":"Central Europe, between Austria and Switzerland","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":47,"min":16},"E":{"deg":9,"min":32}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":160,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":160,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"about 0.9 times the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":76,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Austria 34.9 km, Switzerland 41.1 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"mostly mountainous (Alps) with Rhine Valley in western third","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Ruggeller Riet 430 m","highest point":"Vorder-Grauspitz 2,599 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":75,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":"NA","Natural hazards":"NA","internationalEnvironmentAgreements":{"signed, but not ratified":"Law of the Sea","partyTo":["Air Pollution","Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides","Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants","Air Pollution-Sulfur 85","Air Pollution-Sulfur 94","Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds","Biodiversity","Climate Change","Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol","Desertification","Endangered Species","Hazardous Wastes","Ozone Layer Protection","Wetlands"]},"naturalResources":["hydroelectric potential","arable land"],"environmentalIssues":["NA"],"climate":["continental","cold, cloudy winters with frequent snow or rain","cool to moderately warm, cloudy, humid summers"],"geographyNote":["along with Uzbekistan, one of only two doubly landlocked countries in the world","variety of microclimatic variations based on elevation"]},"people":{"Population":35236,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":16.1,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":69,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"15% (male 2,304/female 2,971) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":41.8,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":41.2,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":42.3,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":0.653,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":9.65,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":7.61,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":{"quantity":4.48,"unit":"migrant(s)/1,000 population"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":14,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Major cities - population":"VADUZ (capital) 5,000 (2009)","Sex ratio":{"at birth":{"quantity":1,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years":{"quantity":0.98,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":0.97,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over":{"quantity":0.77,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population":{"quantity":0.94,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":{"quantity":4.15,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":5.37,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"female":{"quantity":2.92,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"}},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":{"quantity":80.31,"unit":"years"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":76.86,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":83.77,"unit":"years"}},"Total fertility rate":{"quantity":1.53,"unit":"children born/woman"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":"NA","HIV/AIDS - deaths":"NA","Nationality":{"noun":"Liechtensteiner(s)","adjective":"Liechtenstein"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 10 and over can read and write","total population":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"},"male":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"},"female":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"}},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":{"quantity":12,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":13,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":12,"unit":"years"}},"Education expenditures":{"quantity":2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"ethnicGroups":["Liechtensteiner 65.6%","other 34.4% (2000 census)"],"religions":["Roman Catholic 76.2%","Protestant 7%","unknown 10.6%","other 6.2% (June 2002)"],"languages":["German (official)","Alemannic dialect"]},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"Principality of Liechtenstein","conventional short form":"Liechtenstein","local long form":"Fuerstentum Liechtenstein","local short form":"Liechtenstein"},"Government type":"constitutional monarchy","Capital":{"name":"Vaduz","geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":47,"min":8},"E":{"deg":9,"min":31}},"time difference":"UTC+1 (6 hours ahead of Washington, DC during Standard Time)","daylight saving time":"+1hr, begins last Sunday in March;

The Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of small businesses. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 20% - and easy incorporation rules have induced many holding companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein providing 30% of state revenues. The country participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the EU) since May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. In 2008, Liechtenstein came under renewed international pressure - particularly from Germany - to improve transparency in its banking and tax systems. In December 2008, Liechtenstein signed a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the US. Upon Liechtenstein's conclusion of 12 bilateral information-sharing agreements, the OECD in October 2009 removed the principality from its \"grey list\" of countries that had yet to implement the organization's Model Tax Convention. By the end of 2010, Liechtenstein had signed 25 Tax Information Exchange Agreements or Double Tax Agreements.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":5028000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5080000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":36,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":58,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":32880,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":43.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":55,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":943000000},"expenditures":{"usd":820000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Exports":{"usd":2830000000},"Imports":{"usd":1770000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":null},"Exchange rates":"Swiss francs (CHF) per US dollar -","industries":["electronics, metal manufacturing, dental products, ceramics, pharmaceuticals, food products, precision instruments, tourism, optical instruments"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","barley","corn","potatoes","livestock","dairy products"],"exportCommodities":["small specialty machinery","connectors for audio and video","parts for motor vehicles","dental products","hardware","prepared foodstuffs","electronic equipment","optical products"],"importCommodities":["agricultural products","raw materials","energy products","machinery","metal goods","textiles","foodstuffs","motor vehicles"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":19600,"Telephones - mobile cellular":35000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"automatic telephone system","domestic":"fixed-line and mobile-cellular services widely available; combined telephone service subscribership exceeds 150 per 100 persons","international":"country code - 423; linked to Swiss networks by cable and microwave radio relay (2008)"},"Broadcast media":"relies on foreign terrestrial and satellite broadcasters for most broadcast media services; first Liechtenstein-based television station established August 2008; Radio Liechtenstein operates multiple radio stations; a Swiss-based broadcaster operates several radio stations in Liechtenstein (2008)","Internet country code":".li","Internet hosts":9418,"Internet users":23000},"transport":{"Pipelines":"gas 20 km (2010)","Railways":{"total":{"quantity":9,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","standard gauge":"9 km 1.435-m gauge (electrified)"},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":380,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":380,"unit":"km"}},"Waterways":{"quantity":28,"unit":"km"}},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces (constitutionally prohibited); Principality of Liechtenstein National Police (Landespolizei, LP) (2010)","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":8009},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":6538,"females age 16-49":6746},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":219,"female":211},"Military - note":"Liechtenstein has no military forces but is interested in European security policy and is an active member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)"},"issues":{"Illicit drugs":"has strengthened money laundering controls, but money laundering remains a concern due to Liechtenstein's sophisticated offshore financial services sector","internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
