The country is vulnerable to devastating storms. Agriculture employs two-thirds of the labor force and furnishes 90% of exports, featuring coconut cream, coconut oil, and copra. The manufacturing sector mainly processes agricultural products. One factory in the Foreign Trade Zone employs 3,000 people to make automobile electrical harnesses for an assembly plant in Australia. Tourism is an expanding sector accounting for 25% of GDP; 122,000 tourists visited the islands in 2007. In late September 2009, an earthquake and the resulting tsunami severely damaged Samoa, and nearby American Samoa, disrupting transportation and power generation, and resulting in about 200 deaths. The Samoan Government has called for deregulation of the financial sector, encouragement of investment, and continued fiscal discipline, while at the same time protecting the environment. Observers point to the flexibility of the labor market as a basic strength for future economic advances. Foreign reserves are in a relatively healthy state, the external debt is stable, and inflation is low.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1054999999.9999999},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":556000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":11.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":13.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":75.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":66270,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":"NA%"},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":171300000},"expenditures":{"usd":78100000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":12.08,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":80560000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":283200000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":243000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":109000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":101400000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1105,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-24 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":131000000},"Imports":{"usd":324000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":70150000},"Debt - external":{"usd":177000000},"Exchange rates":"tala (SAT) per US dollar -","industries":["food processing, building materials, auto parts"],"agricultureProducts":["coconuts","bananas","taro","yams","coffee","cocoa"],"exportCommodities":["fish","coconut oil and cream","copra","taro","automotive parts","garments","beer"],"exportPartners":["American Samoa 41.12%","Australia 24.74%","Taiwan 6.24%","China 5.61%","US 4.07%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","industrial supplies","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["NZ 24.13%","Fiji 17.34%","Singapore 12.54%","China 10.02%","Australia 9.85%","US 5.95%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":31900,"Telephones - mobile cellular":151000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"adequate","domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity roughly 85 telephones per 100 persons; coverage extended to roughly 95 percent of the country","international":"country code - 685; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean)"},"Broadcast media":"state-owned television station privatized in 2008; 4 privately-owned television broadcast stations; about a half dozen privately-owned radio stations and one state-owned radio station; television and radio broadcasts of several stations from American Samoa are available (2009)","Internet country code":".ws","Internet hosts":17044,"Internet users":9000},"transport":{"Airports":4,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":1,"2,438 to 3,047 m":1},"Airports - with unpaved runways":{"total":3,"under 914 m":3},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":2337,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":332,"unit":"km"},"unpaved":{"quantity":2005,"unit":"km"}},"Merchant marine":{"total":2,"country comparison to the world":"","by type":"passenger/cargo 1, cargo 1","foreign-owned":"1 (NZ 1) (2010)"},"Ports and terminals":"Apia"},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces; Samoa Police Force (2008)","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":47906},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":38260,"females age 16-49":38032},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":2221,"female":2062},"Military expenditures":"NA","Military - note":"Samoa has no formal defense structure or regular armed forces; informal defense ties exist with NZ, which is required to consider any Samoan request for assistance under the 1962 Treaty of Friendship"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
