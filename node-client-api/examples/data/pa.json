{"code":"pa","name":"Paraguay","region":"South America","background":"Paraguay achieved its independence from Spain in 1811. In the disastrous War of the Triple Alliance (1865-70) - between Paraguay and Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay - Paraguay lost two-thirds of all adult males and much of its territory. The country stagnated economically for the next half century. Following the Chaco War of 1932-35 with Bolivia, Paraguay gained a large part of the Chaco lowland region. The 35-year military dictatorship of Alfredo STROESSNER ended in 1989, and, despite a marked increase in political infighting in recent years, Paraguay has held relatively free and regular presidential elections since then.","geo":{"Location":"Central South America, northeast of Argentina, southwest of Brazil","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":23,"min":0},"W":{"deg":58,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":406752,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":397302,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":9450,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than California","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":3995,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Argentina 1,880 km, Bolivia 750 km, Brazil 1,365 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"grassy plains and wooded hills east of Rio Paraguay;

A large percentage of the population, especially in rural areas, derives its living from agricultural activity, often on a subsistence basis. Because of the importance of the informal sector, accurate economic measures are difficult to obtain. On a per capita basis, real income has stagnated at 1980 levels. The economy grew rapidly between 2003 and 2008 as growing world demand for commodities combined with high prices and favorable weather to support Paraguay's commodity-based export expansion. Paraguay is the sixth largest soy producer in the world. Drought hit in 2008, reducing agricultural exports and slowing the economy even before the onset of the global recession. The economy fell 3.8% in 2009, as lower world demand and commodity prices caused exports to contract. The government reacted by introducing fiscal and monetary stimulus packages. Growth resumed at a 14.5% level in 2010, the highest in South America. Political uncertainty, corruption, limited progress on structural reform, and deficient infrastructure are the main obstacles to growth.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":33310000000.000004},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":18480000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":15.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":21.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":18.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":60.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3038000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":26.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":18.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":55,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":18.8,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":42.3,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":53.2,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":17.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":3238000000},"expenditures":{"usd":3402000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":22.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":28.26,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":2600000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":5030000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":4395000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":53190000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":8500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":45140000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":30.96,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":27000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":25100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-391 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":7972000000},"Imports":{"usd":9567000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":4130000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2445000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":3393000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"guarani (PYG) per US dollar -","industries":["sugar, cement, textiles, beverages, wood products, steel, metallurgic, electric power"],"agricultureProducts":["cotton","sugarcane","soybeans","corn","wheat","tobacco","cassava (tapioca)","fruits","vegetables","beef","pork","eggs","milk","timber"],"exportCommodities":["soybeans","feed","cotton","meat","edible oils","electricity","wood","leather"],"exportPartners":["Brazil 21%","Uruguay 17%","Chile 12%","Argentina 11%","Russia 4% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["road vehicles","consumer goods","tobacco","petroleum products","electrical machinery","tractors","chemicals","vehicle parts"],"importPartners":["China 30%","Brazil 23%","Argentina 16%","US 5% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":387300,"Telephones - mobile cellular":5619000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"the fixed-line market is a state monopoly and fixed-line telephone service is meager;
