{"code":"ti","name":"Tajikistan","region":"Central Asia","background":"The Tajik people came under Russian rule in the 1860s and 1870s, but Russia's hold on Central Asia weakened following the Revolution of 1917. Bolshevik control of the area was fiercely contested and not fully reestablished until 1925. Much of present-day Sughd province was transferred from the Uzbek SSR to the newly formed Tajik SSR in 1929. Ethnic Uzbeks form a substantial minority in Tajikistan. Tajikistan became independent in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union, and experienced a civil war between regional factions from 1992-97. Tajikistan experienced several security incidents in 2010, including a mass prison-break from a Dushanbe detention facility, the country's first suicide car bombing in Khujand, and armed conflict between government forces and opposition militants in the Rasht Valley. The country remains the poorest in the former Soviet sphere. Attention by the international community since the beginning of the NATO intervention in Afghanistan has brought increased economic development and security assistance, which could create jobs and strengthen stability in the long term. Tajikistan is seeking WTO membership and has joined NATO's Partnership for Peace.","geo":{"Location":"Central Asia, west of China, south of Kyrgyzstan","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":39,"min":0},"E":{"deg":71,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":143100,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":141510,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":2590,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Wisconsin","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":3651,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Afghanistan 1,206 km, China 414 km, Kyrgyzstan 870 km, Uzbekistan 1,161 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"Pamir and Alay Mountains dominate landscape;

Because of a lack of employment opportunities in Tajikistan, as many as a million Tajik citizens work abroad, almost all of them in Russia, supporting families in Tajikistan through remittances. Less than 7% of the land area is arable. Cotton is the most important crop, and its production is closely monitored, and in many cases controlled, by the government. In the wake of the National Bank of Tajikistan's admission in December 2007 that it had improperly lent money to investors in the cotton sector, the IMF canceled its program in Tajikistan. A reform agenda is underway, according to which over half a billion dollars in farmer debt is being forgiven, and IMF assistance has been reinstated. Mineral resources include silver, gold, uranium, and tungsten. Industry consists only of a large aluminum plant, hydropower facilities, and small obsolete factories mostly in light industry and food processing. The civil war (1992-97) severely damaged the already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in industrial and agricultural production. Tajikistan's economic situation remains fragile due to uneven implementation of structural reforms, corruption, weak governance, seasonal power shortages, and the external debt burden. A debt restructuring agreement was reached with Russia in December 2002, including a $250 million write-off of Tajikistan's $300 million debt. Electricity output expanded with the completion of the Sangtuda I hydropower dam - finished in 2009 with Russian investment. The smaller Sangtuda-2, built with Iranian investment, is scheduled for completion in 2012. The government of Tajikistan is pinning major hopes on the massive Roghun dam which, if finished according to Tajik plans, will be the tallest dam in the world. The World Bank has agreed to fund technical, economic, social, and environmental feasibility studies for the dam. Favorable reports from these studies could create investor interest in the project, which is currently moving forward with domestic funding. In January 2010, the government began selling shares in the Roghun enterprise to its population, ultimately raising over $180 million. According to numerous reports, many Tajik individuals and businesses were forced to buy shares. The coerced share sales finally ended in mid-2010 under intense criticism from donors, particularly the IMF. Tajikistan has received substantial infrastructure development loans from the Chinese government to improve roads and electricity transmission. To help increase north-south trade, the US funded a $36 million bridge which opened in August 2007 linking Tajikistan with Afghanistan. While Tajikistan has experienced steady economic growth since 1997, more than half of the population continues to live in poverty. Economic growth reached 10.6% in 2004, but dropped below 8% in 2005-08, as the effects of higher oil prices and then the international financial crisis began to register - mainly in the form of lower prices for key export commodities and lower remittances from Tajiks working abroad.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":14740000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5642000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":19.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":22.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":58.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2100000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":49.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":12.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":37.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":53,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":25.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":32.6,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1482000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1538000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":22.91,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":863000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1095000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1209000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":16100000000.000002,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":16700000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":"NA kWh (2008 est.)","Electricity - imports":{"quantity":338500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":221,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":38000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":348.9,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":10100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":12000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":16100000.000000002,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":266100000.00000003,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":250000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":5663000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-330 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1318000000},"Imports":{"usd":3301000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":303000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1997000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":100300000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":18500000000},"Exchange rates":"Tajikistani somoni (TJS) per US dollar -","industries":["aluminum, cement, vegetable oil"],"agricultureProducts":["cotton","grain","fruits","grapes","vegetables","cattle","sheep","goats"],"exportCommodities":["aluminum","electricity","cotton","fruits","vegetable oil","textiles"],"exportPartners":["Russia 19.16%","China 18.38%","Turkey 12.09%","Iran 11.11%","Uzbekistan 7.92%","Norway 6.17%","Greece 4.32%"],"importCommodities":["petroleum products","aluminum oxide","machinery and equipment","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["Russia 23.92%","China 23.74%","Kazakhstan 8.92%","Turkey 4.96%","Uzbekistan 4.73%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":290000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":4900000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"foreign investment in the telephone system has resulted in major improvements;
