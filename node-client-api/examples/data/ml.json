{"code":"ml","name":"Mali","region":"Africa","background":"The Sudanese Republic and Senegal became independent of France in 1960 as the Mali Federation. When Senegal withdrew after only a few months, what formerly made up the Sudanese Republic was renamed Mali. Rule by dictatorship was brought to a close in 1991 by a military coup - led by the current president Amadou TOURE - enabling Mali's emergence as one of the strongest democracies on the continent. President Alpha KONARE won Mali's first democratic presidential election in 1992 and was reelected in 1997. In keeping with Mali's two-term constitutional limit, KONARE stepped down in 2002 and was succeeded by Amadou TOURE, who was subsequently elected to a second term in 2007. The elections were widely judged to be free and fair.","geo":{"Location":"interior Western Africa, southwest of Algeria, north of Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, and Burkina Faso, west of Niger","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":17,"min":0},"W":{"deg":4,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":1240,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":1220,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":20002,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than twice the size of Texas","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":7243,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Algeria 1,376 km, Burkina Faso 1,000 km, Guinea 858 km, Cote d'Ivoire 532 km, Mauritania 2,237 km, Niger 821 km, Senegal 419 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"mostly flat to rolling northern plains covered by sand;

The country's fiscal status fluctuates with gold and agricultural commodity prices and the harvest. Mali remains dependent on foreign aid. Economic activity is largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger River and about 65% of its land area is desert or semidesert. About 10% of the population is nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is engaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on processing farm commodities. The government has continued an IMF-recommended structural adjustment program that has helped the economy grow, diversify, and attract foreign investment. Mali is developing its cotton and iron ore extraction industries to diversify its revenue sources because gold production has started to fall. Mali has invested in tourism but security issues are hurting the industry. Mali's adherence to economic reform and the 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 have pushed up economic growth to a 5% average in 1996-2010. Worker remittances and external trade routes for the landlocked country have been jeopardized by continued unrest in neighboring Cote d'Ivoire. However, Mali is building a road network that will connect it to all adjacent countries and it has a railway line to Senegal. In 2010, Mali experienced a regional drought that hurt livestock and livelihoods.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":16770000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":9268000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":45,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":38,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3241000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":36.1,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":30.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":40.1,"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1500000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1800000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1758000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2514000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":994900000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":515000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":479000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"Electricity - exports":"NA kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":6000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4402,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-446 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":294000000},"Imports":{"usd":2358000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2800000000},"Exchange rates":"Communaute Financiere Africaine francs (XOF) per US dollar -","industries":["food processing","construction","phosphate and gold mining"],"agricultureProducts":["cotton","millet","rice","corn","vegetables","peanuts","cattle","sheep","goats"],"exportCommodities":["cotton","gold","livestock"],"exportPartners":["China 14.61%","Thailand 8.28%","Pakistan 6.74%","Morocco 6.48%","Burkina Faso 4.67%","France 4.6%","India 4.45%"],"importCommodities":["petroleum","machinery and equipment","construction materials","foodstuffs","textiles"],"importPartners":["Senegal 12.21%","France 11.57%","Cote d'Ivoire 10.05%","China 5.89%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":81000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":3742000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"domestic system unreliable but improving;
