{"code":"vm","name":"Vietnam","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"The conquest of Vietnam by France began in 1858 and was completed by 1884. It became part of French Indochina in 1887. Vietnam declared independence after World War II, but France continued to rule until its 1954 defeat by Communist forces under Ho Chi MINH. Under the Geneva Accords of 1954, Vietnam was divided into the Communist North and anti-Communist South. US economic and military aid to South Vietnam grew through the 1960s in an attempt to bolster the government, but US armed forces were withdrawn following a cease-fire agreement in 1973. Two years later, North Vietnamese forces overran the South reuniting the country under Communist rule. Despite the return of peace, for over a decade the country experienced little economic growth because of conservative leadership policies, the persecution and mass exodus of individuals - many of them successful South Vietnamese merchants - and growing international isolation. However, since the enactment of Vietnam's \"doi moi\" (renovation) policy in 1986, Vietnamese authorities have committed to increased economic liberalization and enacted structural reforms needed to modernize the economy and to produce more competitive, export-driven industries. The Communist leaders, however, maintain control on political expression and have resisted outside calls to improve human rights. The country continues to experience small-scale protests from various groups, the vast majority connected to land-use issues, calls for increased political space and the lack of equitable mechanisms for resolving disputes. Various ethnic minorities, such as the Montagnards of the Central Highlands and the Khmer Krom in the southern delta region, have also held protests.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Asia, bordering the Gulf of Thailand, Gulf of Tonkin, and South China Sea, as well as China, Laos, and Cambodia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":16,"min":10},"E":{"deg":107,"min":50}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":331210,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":310070,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":21140,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than New Mexico","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":4639,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Cambodia 1,228 km, China 1,281 km, Laos 2,130 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":3444,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"low, flat delta in south and north;

While Vietnam's economy remains dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which still produce about 40% of GDP, Vietnamese authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to economic liberalization and international integration. They have moved to implement the structural reforms needed to modernize the economy and to produce more competitive export-driven industries. Vietnam joined the WTO in January 2007 following more than a decade-long negotiation process. Vietnam became an official negotiating partner in the developing Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement in 2010. Agriculture's share of economic output has continued to shrink from about 25% in 2000 to about 20% in 2010, while industry's share increased from 36% to 41% in the same period. Deep poverty has declined significantly and Vietnam is working to create jobs to meet the challenge of a labor force that is growing by more than one million people every year. The global recession has hurt Vietnam's export-oriented economy, with GDP in 2009-10 growing less than the 7% per annum average achieved during the last decade. In 2010, exports increased by more than 25%, year-on-year, but the trade deficit remained high, prompting the government to consider administrative measures to limit the trade deficit. Vietnam's managed currency, the dong, continues to face downward pressure due to a persistent trade imbalance, and, since 2008, the government devalued it by 20% through a series of small devaluations. Foreign donors pledged nearly $8 billion in new development assistance for 2011. However, the government's strong growth-oriented economic policies have caused it to struggle to control one of the region's highest inflation rates, which reached 11.8% in 2010. Vietnam's economy also faces challenges from falling foreign exchange reserves, an undercapitalized banking sector, and high borrowing costs. The near-bankruptcy and subsequent default of the SOE Vinashin, a leading shipbuilder, led to a ratings downgrade of Vietnam's sovereign debt, exacerbating Vietnam's borrowing difficulties.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":276600000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":103600000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":20.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":41.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":38.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":46210000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":53.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":25.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":10.6,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":29.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":37,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":35.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":27080000000},"expenditures":{"usd":29650000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":56.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":11.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":15.78,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":33759999999.999996},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":118800000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":132100000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":37000000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":97300000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":85600000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":535000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":3850000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":300600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":311400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":171500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":182300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":4700000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":9400000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":10300000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":905800,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":680000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-12.22 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":72030000000},"Imports":{"usd":84300000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":13000000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":33450000000.000004},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":77950000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":7700000000},"Exchange rates":"dong (VND) per US dollar -","industries":["food processing, garments, shoes, machine-building","mining, coal, steel","cement, chemical fertilizer, glass, tires, oil, paper"],"agricultureProducts":["paddy rice","coffee","rubber","cotton","tea","pepper","soybeans","cashews","sugar cane","peanuts","bananas","poultry","fish","seafood"],"exportCommodities":["clothes","shoes","marine products","crude oil","electronics","wooden products","rice","machinery"],"exportPartners":["US 20%","Japan 10.7%","China 9.8%","South Korea 4.3% (2010 est.)"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","petroleum products","steel products","raw materials for the clothing and shoe industries","electronics","plastics","automobiles"],"importPartners":["China 23.8%","South Korea 11.6%","Japan 10.8%","Taiwan 8.4%","Thailand 6.7%","Singapore 4.9% (2010 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":17427000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":98224000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"Vietnam is putting considerable effort into modernization and expansion of its telecommunication system","domestic":"all provincial exchanges are digitalized and connected to Hanoi, Da Nang, and Ho Chi Minh City by fiber-optic cable or microwave radio relay networks;
