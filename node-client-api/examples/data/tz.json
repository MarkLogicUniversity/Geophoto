Zanzibar's semi-autonomous status and popular opposition have led to two contentious elections since 1995, which the ruling party won despite international observers' claims of voting irregularities.

The economy depends heavily on agriculture, which accounts for more than 40% of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs about 80% of the work force. The World Bank, the IMF, and bilateral donors have provided funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's aging economic infrastructure, including rail and port infrastructure that are important trade links for inland countries. Recent banking reforms have helped increase private-sector growth and investment, and the government has increased spending on agriculture to 7% of its budget. Continued donor assistance and solid macroeconomic policies supported a positive growth rate, despite the world recession. In 2008, Tanzania received the world's largest Millennium Challenge Compact grant, worth $698 million. Dar es Salaam used fiscal stimulus and loosened monetary policy to ease the impact of the global recession. GDP growth in 2009-10 was a respectable 6% per year due to high gold prices and increased production.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":58440000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":22670000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":42,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":21860000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":36,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":26.9,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":34.6,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":17.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":4263000000},"expenditures":{"usd":5644000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":23.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":3.7,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":15.03,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":3394000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":7440000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":4163000.0000000005},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2009)","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":3786000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":3182000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":200000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":34000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":28070,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":560700000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":560700000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":6513000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.523 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":3809000000},"Imports":{"usd":6334000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3687000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Debt - external":{"usd":7576000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Tanzanian shillings (TZS) per US dollar -","industries":["agricultural processing (sugar, beer, cigarettes, sisal twine)","diamond, gold, and iron mining, salt, soda ash","cement, oil refining, shoes, apparel, wood products, fertilizer"],"agricultureProducts":["coffee","sisal","tea","cotton","pyrethrum (insecticide made from chrysanthemums)","cashew nuts","tobacco","cloves","corn","wheat","cassava (tapioca)","bananas","fruits","vegetables","cattle","sheep","goats"],"exportCommodities":["gold","coffee","cashew nuts","manufactures","cotton"],"exportPartners":["India 8.51%","China 7.55%","Japan 7.12%","Netherlands 6.21%","UAE 5.71%","Germany 5.17%"],"importCommodities":["consumer goods","machinery and transportation equipment","industrial raw materials","crude oil"],"importPartners":["India 13.97%","China 13.71%","South Africa 7.8%","Kenya 6.89%","UAE 4.65%","Japan 4.34%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":173552,"Telephones - mobile cellular":17677000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"telecommunications services are marginal;
