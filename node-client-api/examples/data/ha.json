{"code":"ha","name":"Haiti","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"The native Taino Amerindians - who inhabited the island of Hispaniola when it was discovered by COLUMBUS in 1492 - were virtually annihilated by Spanish settlers within 25 years. In the early 17th century, the French established a presence on Hispaniola. In 1697, Spain ceded to the French the western third of the island, which later became Haiti. The French colony, based on forestry and sugar-related industries, became one of the wealthiest in the Caribbean but only through the heavy importation of African slaves and considerable environmental degradation. In the late 18th century, Haiti's nearly half million slaves revolted under Toussaint L'OUVERTURE. After a prolonged struggle, Haiti became the first black republic to declare independence in 1804. The poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti has been plagued by political violence for most of its history. After an armed rebellion led to the forced resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand ARISTIDE in February 2004, an interim government took office to organize new elections under the auspices of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Continued violence and technical delays prompted repeated postponements, but Haiti finally did inaugurate a democratically elected president and parliament in May of 2006. A massive magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti in January 2010 with an epicenter about 15 km southwest of the capital, Port-au-Prince. An estimated 2 million people lived within the zone of heavy to moderate structural damage. The earthquake was assessed as the worst in this region over the last 200 years and massive international assistance will be required to help the country recover.","geo":{"Location":"Caribbean, western one-third of the island of Hispaniola, between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, west of the Dominican Republic","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":19,"min":0},"W":{"deg":72,"min":25}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":27750,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":27560,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":190,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Maryland","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":360,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Dominican Republic 360 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1771,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"to depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"mostly rough and mountainous","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caribbean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Chaine de la Selle 2,680 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":28.11,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":11.53,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":60.36,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":920,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":14,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":0.99,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":116,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"lies in the middle of the hurricane belt and subject to severe storms from June to October;

Poverty, corruption, and poor access to education for much of the population are among Haiti's most serious disadvantages. Over the longer term, Haiti needs to create jobs for its young workforce and to build institutional capacity. Haiti's economy suffered a severe setback when a 7.0 magnitude earthquake destroyed much of its capital city, Port-au-Prince, and neighboring areas in January 2010. Already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with 80% of the population living under the poverty line and 54% in abject poverty, the damage to Port-au-Prince caused the country's GDP to contract an estimated 5.1% in 2010. Two-thirds of all Haitians depend on the agricultural sector, mainly small-scale subsistence farming, and remain vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters, exacerbated by the country's widespread deforestation. US economic engagement under the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act, passed in December 2006, has boosted apparel exports and investment by providing duty-free access to the US. Congress voted in 2010 to extend the legislation until 2020 under the Haitian Economic Lift Act (HELP); the apparel sector accounts for three-quarters of Haitian exports and nearly one-tenth of GDP. Remittances are the primary source of foreign exchange, equaling nearly 20% of GDP and more than twice the earnings from exports. Haiti suffers from a lack of investment, partly because of limited infrastructure and a lack of security. In 2005, Haiti paid its arrears to the World Bank, paving the way for reengagement with the Bank. Haiti received debt forgiveness for over $1 billion through the Highly-Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative in mis-2009. The remainder of its outstanding external debt was cancelled by donor countries in early 2010 but has since risen to about $400 million. The government relies on formal international economic assistance for fiscal sustainability, with over half of its annual budget coming from outside sources.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":11480000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":6632000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-5.1% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":59,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":4810000,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":38.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":11.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":50.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":40.6,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":47.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":59.2,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":25,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":900000000},"expenditures":{"usd":2600000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.7,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":970000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":3249000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":960100000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":"-4.8% (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":650000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":309000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":"NA kWh (2010 est.)","Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":12000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":12280,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-781 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":530200000.00000006},"Imports":{"usd":2727000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1587000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":350000000},"Exchange rates":"gourdes (HTG) per US dollar -","industries":["textiles, sugar refining, flour milling, cement, light assembly based on imported parts"],"agricultureProducts":["coffee","mangoes","sugarcane","rice","corn","sorghum","wood"],"exportCommodities":["apparel","manufactures","oils","cocoa","mangoes","coffee"],"exportPartners":["US 79.76%","Dominican Republic 7.24%","Canada 2.96%"],"importCommodities":["food","manufactured goods","machinery and transport equipment","fuels","raw materials"],"importPartners":["US 33.11%","Dominican Republic 23.53%","Netherlands Antilles 10.75%","China 5.36%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":108300,"Telephones - mobile cellular":3648000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"telecommunications infrastructure is among the least developed in Latin America and the Caribbean;
