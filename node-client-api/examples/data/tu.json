{"code":"tu","name":"Turkey","region":"Middle East","background":"Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 from the Anatolian remnants of the defeated Ottoman Empire by national hero Mustafa KEMAL, who was later honored with the title Ataturk or \"Father of the Turks.\" Under his authoritarian leadership, the country adopted wide-ranging social, legal, and political reforms. After a period of one-party rule, an experiment with multi-party politics led to the 1950 election victory of the opposition Democratic Party and the peaceful transfer of power. Since then, Turkish political parties have multiplied, but democracy has been fractured by periods of instability and intermittent military coups (1960, 1971, 1980), which in each case eventually resulted in a return of political power to civilians. In 1997, the military again helped engineer the ouster - popularly dubbed a \"post-modern coup\" - of the then Islamic-oriented government. Turkey intervened militarily on Cyprus in 1974 to prevent a Greek takeover of the island and has since acted as patron state to the \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,\" which only Turkey recognizes. A separatist insurgency begun in 1984 by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - now known as the People's Congress of Kurdistan or Kongra-Gel (KGK) - has dominated the Turkish military's attention and claimed more than 30,000 lives. After the capture of the group's leader in 1999, the insurgents largely withdrew from Turkey mainly to northern Iraq. In 2004, KGK announced an end to its ceasefire and attacks attributed to the KGK increased. Turkey joined the UN in 1945 and in 1952 it became a member of NATO. In 1964, Turkey became an associate member of the European Community. Over the past decade, it has undertaken many reforms to strengthen its democracy and economy; it began accession membership talks with the European Union in 2005.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Europe and Southwestern Asia (that portion of Turkey west of the Bosporus is geographically part of Europe), bordering the Black Sea, between Bulgaria and Georgia, and bordering the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, between Greece and Syria","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":39,"min":0},"E":{"deg":35,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":783562,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":769632,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":13930,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Texas","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":2648,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Armenia 268 km, Azerbaijan 9 km, Bulgaria 240 km, Georgia 252 km, Greece 206 km, Iran 499 km, Iraq 352 km, Syria 822 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":7200,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":"6 nm in the Aegean Sea;

An aggressive privatization program has reduced state involvement in basic industry, banking, transport, and communication, and an emerging cadre of middle-class entrepreneurs is adding dynamism to the economy. Turkey's traditional textiles and clothing sectors still account for one-third of industrial employment, despite stiff competition in international markets that resulted from the end of the global quota system. Other sectors, notably the automotive, construction, and electronics industries, are rising in importance and have surpassed textiles within Turkey's export mix. Oil began to flow through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in May 2006, marking a major milestone that will bring up to 1 million barrels per day from the Caspian to market. Several gas pipelines also are being planned to help move Central Asian gas to Europe via Turkey, which will help address Turkey's dependence on energy imports over the long term. After Turkey experienced a severe financial crisis in 2001, Ankara adopted financial and fiscal reforms as part of an IMF program. The reforms strengthened the country's economic fundamentals and ushered in an era of strong growth - averaging more than 6% annually until 2008, when global economic conditions and tighter fiscal policy caused GDP to contract in 2009, reduced inflation to 6.3% - a 34-year low - and cut the public sector debt-to-GPD ratio below 50%. Turkey's well-regulated financial markets and banking system weathered the global financial crisis and GDP rebounded strongly to 7.3% in 2010, as exports returned to normal levels following the recession. The economy, however, continues to be burdened by a high current account deficit and remains dependent on often volatile, short-term investment to finance its trade deficit. The stock value of FDI stood at $174 billion at year-end 2010, but inflows have slowed considerably in light of continuing economic turmoil in Europe, the source of much of Turkey's FDI. Further economic and judicial reforms and prospective EU membership are expected to boost Turkey's attractiveness to foreign investors. However, Turkey's relatively high current account deficit, uncertainty related to policy-making, and fiscal imbalances leave the economy vulnerable to destabilizing shifts in investor confidence.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":960500000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":741900000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":8.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":8.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":25.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":65.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":24730000,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":29.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":45.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":12.4,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":17.11,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":33.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":41,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":159400000000},"expenditures":{"usd":189600000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":48.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":8.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":57020000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":255500000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":401800000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":225700000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":198400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":198100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":1120000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":790000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":52980,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":579500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":133100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":734600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":262200000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":1014000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":35070000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":708000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":35770000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":6088000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-38.82 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":117400000000},"Imports":{"usd":166300000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":78000000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":270700000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":84450000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":16420000000.000002},"Exchange rates":"Turkish liras (TRY) per US dollar -","industries":["textiles, food processing, autos, electronics, mining (coal, chromate, copper, boron), steel, petroleum, construction, lumber, paper"],"agricultureProducts":["tobacco","cotton","grain","olives","sugar beets","hazelnuts","pulse","citrus","livestock"],"exportCommodities":["apparel","foodstuffs","textiles","metal manufactures","transport equipment"],"exportPartners":["Germany 9.6%","France 6.1%","UK 5.8%","Italy 5.8%","Iraq 5% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["machinery","chemicals","semi-finished goods","fuels","transport equipment"],"importPartners":["Russia 14%","Germany 10%","China 9%","US 6.1%","Italy 5.4%","France 5% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":16533999.999999998,"Telephones - mobile cellular":62780000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"comprehensive telecommunications network undergoing rapid modernization and expansion especially in mobile-cellular services","domestic":"additional digital exchanges are permitting a rapid increase in subscribers;
