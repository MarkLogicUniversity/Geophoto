Industry is concentrated mainly in the more heavily-populated region of Flanders in the north. With few natural resources, Belgium imports substantial quantities of raw materials and exports a large volume of manufactures, making its economy vulnerable to volatility in world markets, yet also able to benefit from them. Roughly three-quarters of Belgium's trade is with other EU countries, and Belgium has benefited most from its proximity to Germany. In 2010 Belgian GDP grew by 2.1%, the unemployment rate rose slightly, and the government reduced the budget deficit, which had worsened in 2008 and 2009 because of large-scale bail-outs in the financial sector. Belgium's budget deficit decreased from 6% of GDP to 4.8% in 2010, while public debt was just under 100% of GDP. Belgian banks were severely affected by the international financial crisis with three major banks receiving capital injections from the government. An ageing population and rising social expenditures are mid- to long-term challenges to public finances.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":394300000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":465700000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":22.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":77.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5020000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":73,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":15.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":28.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":28,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":220600000000},"expenditures":{"usd":242600000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":98.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":6.15,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":172900000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":539400000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":801100000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":261399999999.99997},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":82170000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":84880000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":6561000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":17160000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":11220,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":608200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":433700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1120000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":16870000000.000002,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":16780000000.000002,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.129 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":279200000000},"Imports":{"usd":281700000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":1241000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":741700000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":632800000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["engineering and metal products, motor vehicle assembly, transportation equipment, scientific instruments, processed food and beverages, chemicals, basic metals, textiles, glass, petroleum"],"agricultureProducts":["sugar beets","fresh vegetables","fruits","grain","tobacco","beef","veal","pork","milk"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and equipment","chemicals","finished diamonds","metals and metal products","foodstuffs"],"exportPartners":["Germany 19.58%","France 17.71%","Netherlands 11.84%","UK 7.21%","US 5.37%","Italy 4.77%"],"importCommodities":["raw materials","machinery and equipment","chemicals","raw diamonds","pharmaceuticals","foodstuffs","transportation equipment","oil products"],"importPartners":["Netherlands 17.93%","Germany 17.14%","France 11.69%","Ireland 6.26%","US 5.74%","UK 5.07%","China 4.09%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":4255000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":12419000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"highly developed, technologically advanced, and completely automated domestic and international telephone and telegraph facilities","domestic":"nationwide mobile-cellular telephone system;
