{"code":"mp","name":"Mauritius","region":"Africa","background":"Although known to Arab and Malay sailors as early as the 10th century, Mauritius was first explored by the Portuguese in the 16th century and subsequently settled by the Dutch - who named it in honor of Prince Maurits van NASSAU - in the 17th century. The French assumed control in 1715, developing the island into an important naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade, and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane. The British captured the island in 1810, during the Napoleonic Wars. Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base, and later an air station, playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations, as well as the collection of signals intelligence. Independence from the UK was attained in 1968. A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, the country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has earned one of Africa's highest per capita incomes. Recent poor weather, declining sugar prices, and declining textile and apparel production, have slowed economic growth, leading to some protests over standards of living in the Creole community.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Africa, island in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":20,"min":17},"E":{"deg":57,"min":33}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":2040,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":2030,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":10,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"almost 11 times the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":177,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"Maritime claims":"measured from claimed archipelagic straight baselines","territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"small coastal plain rising to discontinuous mountains encircling central plateau","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Indian Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Mont Piton 828 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":49.02,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":2.94,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":48.04,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":210,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":0.61,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":488,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"cyclones (November to April);

For most of the period, annual growth has been in the order of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in more equitable income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure. The economy rests on sugar, tourism, textiles and apparel, and financial services, and is expanding into fish processing, information and communications technology, and hospitality and property development. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land area and accounts for 15% of export earnings. The government's development strategy centers on creating vertical and horizontal clusters of development in these sectors. Mauritius has attracted more than 32,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce in India, South Africa, and China. Investment in the banking sector alone has reached over $1 billion. Mauritius, with its strong textile sector, has been well poised to take advantage of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Mauritius' sound economic policies and prudent banking practices helped to mitigate negative effects from the global financial crisis in 2008-09. GDP grew 3.6% in 2010 and the country continues to expand its trade and investment outreach around the globe.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":18060000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":9729000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":70.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":597000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture and fishing":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"construction and industry":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"transportation and communication":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"trade, restaurants, hotels":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"},"finance":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":39,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":23.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":2113999999.9999998},"expenditures":{"usd":2583000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":60.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":19.25,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1889000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":9605000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":10230000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":4740000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":2321000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2158000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":23000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":22200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-949 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":2041000000},"Imports":{"usd":3935000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2360000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":5043000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Mauritian rupees (MUR) per US dollar -","industries":["food processing (largely sugar milling), textiles, clothing, mining, chemicals, metal products, transport equipment, nonelectrical machinery, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["sugarcane","tea","corn","potatoes","bananas","pulses","cattle","goats","fish"],"exportCommodities":["clothing and textiles","sugar","cut flowers","molasses","fish"],"exportPartners":["UK 25.55%","France 16.89%","US 9.51%","Italy 5.68%","UAE 5.47%","Belgium 4.93%","Madagascar 4.11%"],"importCommodities":["manufactured goods","capital equipment","foodstuffs","petroleum products","chemicals"],"importPartners":["India 24.5%","France 14.02%","South Africa 8.55%","China 8.17%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":379100,"Telephones - mobile cellular":1087000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"small system with good service","domestic":"monopoly over fixed-line services terminated in 2005;
