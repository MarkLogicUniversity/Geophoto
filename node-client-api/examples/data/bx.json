{"code":"bx","name":"Brunei","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"The Sultanate of Brunei's influence peaked between the 15th and 17th centuries when its control extended over coastal areas of northwest Borneo and the southern Philippines. Brunei subsequently entered a period of decline brought on by internal strife over royal succession, colonial expansion of European powers, and piracy. In 1888, Brunei became a British protectorate; independence was achieved in 1984. The same family has ruled Brunei for over six centuries. Brunei benefits from extensive petroleum and natural gas fields, the source of one of the highest per capita GDPs in Asia.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Asia, bordering the South China Sea and Malaysia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":4,"min":30},"E":{"deg":114,"min":40}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":5765,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":5265,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":500,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Delaware","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":381,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Malaysia 381 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":161,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":"200 nm or to median line"},"Terrain":"flat coastal plain rises to mountains in east;
