{"code":"tx","name":"Turkmenistan","region":"Central Asia","background":"Eastern Turkmenistan for centuries formed part of the Persian province of Khurasan; in medieval times Merv (today known as Mary) was one of the great cities of the Islamic world and an important stop on the Silk Road. Annexed by Russia between 1865 and 1885, Turkmenistan became a Soviet republic in 1924. It achieved independence upon the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. Extensive hydrocarbon/natural gas reserves could prove a boon to this underdeveloped country once extraction and delivery projects are expanded. The Turkmen Government is actively working to diversify its gas export routes beyond the still dominant Russian pipeline network. In 2010, new gas export pipelines that carry Turkmen gas to China and to northern Iran began operating, effectively ending the Russian monopoly on Turkmen gas exports. President for Life Saparmurat NYYAZOW died in December 2006, and Turkmenistan held its first multi-candidate presidential election in February 2007. Gurbanguly BERDIMUHAMEDOW, a deputy cabinet chairman under NYYAZOW, emerged as the country's new president.","geo":{"Location":"Central Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran and Kazakhstan","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":40,"min":0},"E":{"deg":60,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":488100,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":469930,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":18170,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than California","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":3736,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Afghanistan 744 km, Iran 992 km, Kazakhstan 379 km, Uzbekistan 1,621 km"},"Coastline":"0 km;

The two largest crops are cotton, most of which is produced for export, and wheat, which is domestically consumed. Although agriculture accounts for roughly 10% of GDP, it continues to employ nearly half of the country's workforce. With an authoritarian ex-Communist regime in power and a tribally based social structure, Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic reform, hoping to use gas and cotton export revenues to sustain its inefficient economy. Privatization goals remain limited. From 1998-2005, Turkmenistan suffered from the continued lack of adequate export routes for natural gas and from obligations on extensive short-term external debt. At the same time, however, total exports rose by an average of roughly 15% per year from 2003-08, largely because of higher international oil and gas prices. New pipelines to China and Iran, that began operation in early 2010, have given Turkmenistan additional export routes for its gas, although these new routes have not offset the sharp drop in export revenue since early 2009 from decreased gas exports to Russia. Overall prospects in the near future are discouraging because of widespread internal poverty, endemic corruption, a poor educational system, government misuse of oil and gas revenues, and Ashgabat's reluctance to adopt market-oriented reforms. In the past, Turkmenistan's economic statistics were state secrets. The new government has established a State Agency for Statistics, but GDP numbers and other figures are subject to wide margins of error. In particular, the rate of GDP growth is uncertain. Since his election, President BERDIMUHAMEDOW unified the country's dual currency exchange rate, ordered the redenomination of the manat, reduced state subsidies for gasoline, and initiated development of a special tourism zone on the Caspian Sea. Although foreign investment is encouraged, numerous bureaucratic obstacles impede international business activity.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":36900000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":27960000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":9.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":10.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":59.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2300000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":48.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":37.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":60,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":31.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":40.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":12.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1970000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1878000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":573000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1052999999.9999999},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2089000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7.3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":15500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":13000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":2500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":197700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":120000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":38360,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":600000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":34000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":20000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":14000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":7504000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":3081000000},"Exports":{"usd":9672000000},"Imports":{"usd":4888000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":10810000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":5000000000},"Exchange rates":"Turkmen manat (TMM) per US dollar -","industries":["natural gas, oil, petroleum products, textiles, food processing"],"agricultureProducts":["cotton","grain","livestock"],"exportCommodities":["gas","crude oil","petrochemicals","textiles","cotton fiber"],"exportPartners":["Ukraine 22.3%","Turkey 10.27%","Hungary 6.75%","UAE 6.25%","Poland 6.16%","Afghanistan 5.79%","Iran 5.17%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","chemicals","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["China 18.03%","Turkey 16.49%","Russia 16.45%","Germany 5.91%","UAE 5.81%","Ukraine 5.67%","US 5.41%","France 4.32%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":478000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":1500000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"telecommunications network remains underdeveloped and progress toward improvement is slow;
