{"code":"ck","name":"Cocos (Keeling) Islands","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"There are 27 coral islands in the group. Captain William KEELING discovered the islands in 1609, but they remained uninhabited until the 19th century. From the 1820s to 1978, members of the CLUNIE-ROSS family controlled the islands and the copra produced from local coconuts. Annexed by the UK in 1857, the Cocos Islands were transferred to the Australian Government in 1955. The population on the two inhabited islands generally is split between the ethnic Europeans on West Island and the ethnic Malays on Home Island.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Asia, group of islands in the Indian Ocean, southwest of Indonesia, about halfway between Australia and Sri Lanka","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":12,"min":30},"E":{"deg":96,"min":50}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":14,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":14,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"about 24 times the size of The Mall in Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":26,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive fishing zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"flat, low-lying coral atolls","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Indian Ocean 0 m","highest point":"unnamed location 5 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":"NA","Natural hazards":"cyclone season is October to April","naturalResources":["fish"],"environmentalIssues":["freshwater resources are limited to rainwater accumulations in natural underground reservoirs"],"climate":["tropical with high humidity, moderated by the southeast trade winds for about nine months of the year"],"geographyNote":["islands are thickly covered with coconut palms and other vegetation","site of a World War I naval battle in November 1914 between the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney and the German raider SMS Emden","after being heavily damaged in the engagement, the Emden was beached by her captain on North Keeling Island"]},"people":{"Population":596,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"NA","15-64 years":"NA","65 years and over":"NA"},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":"NA","Death rate":"NA","Net migration rate":"NA","Infant mortality rate":{"total":"NA","male":"NA","female":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"NA","male":"NA","female":"NA"},"Total fertility rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":"NA","HIV/AIDS - deaths":"NA","Nationality":{"noun":"Cocos Islander(s)","adjective":"Cocos Islander"},"Literacy":"NA","School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":"NA","Education expenditures":"NA","ethnicGroups":["Europeans","Cocos Malays"],"religions":["Sunni Muslim 80%","other 20% (2002 est.)"],"languages":["Malay (Cocos dialect)","English"]},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands","conventional short form":"Cocos (Keeling) Islands"},"Dependency status":"non-self governing territory of Australia; administered from Canberra by the Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government","Government type":"NA","Capital":{"name":"West Island","geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":12,"min":10},"E":{"deg":96,"min":50}},"time difference":"UTC+6.5 (11.5 hours ahead of Washington, DC during Standard Time)"},"Independence":"none (territory of Australia)","National holiday":"Australia Day, 26 January (1788)","Legal system":"common law based on the Australian model","Suffrage":"18 years of age","Executive branch":{"chief of state":"Queen ELIZABETH II (since 6 February 1952); represented by the Australian governor general","head of government":"Administrator (nonresident) Brian LACY (since 5 October 2009)","cabinet":"NA","elections":"the monarchy is hereditary; governor general appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the Australian prime minister; administrator appointed by the governor general of Australia and represents the monarch and Australia"},"Legislative branch":{"Legislative branch":"unicameral Cocos (Keeling) Islands Shire Council (7 seats)","elections":"held every two years with half the members standing for election; last held in October 2009 (next to be held in Ocotber 2011)"},"Judicial branch":"Supreme Court; Magistrate's Court","Political parties and leaders":"none","Political pressure groups and leaders":"The Cocos Islands Youth Support Centre","Diplomatic representation in the US":"none (territory of Australia)","Diplomatic representation from the US":"none (territory of Australia)","Flag description":"the flag of Australia is used","National anthem":{"note":"as a territory of Australia, \"Advance Australia Fair\" remains official as the national anthem, while \"God Save the Queen\" serves as the royal anthem (see Australia)"},"internationalOrganizations":["none"],"administrativeDivisions":["none (territory of Australia)"]},"economy":{"Economy - overview":"Coconuts, grown throughout the islands, are the sole cash crop.
