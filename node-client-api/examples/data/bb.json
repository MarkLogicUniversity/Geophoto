{"code":"bb","name":"Barbados","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"The island was uninhabited when first settled by the British in 1627. Slaves worked the sugar plantations established on the island until 1834 when slavery was abolished. The economy remained heavily dependent on sugar, rum, and molasses production through most of the 20th century. The gradual introduction of social and political reforms in the 1940s and 1950s led to complete independence from the UK in 1966. In the 1990s, tourism and manufacturing surpassed the sugar industry in economic importance.","geo":{"Location":"Caribbean, island in the North Atlantic Ocean, northeast of Venezuela","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":13,"min":10},"W":{"deg":59,"min":32}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":430,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":430,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"2.5 times the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":97,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"relatively flat;

However, in recent years the economy has diversified into light industry and tourism with about three-quarters of GDP and 80% of exports being attributed to services. Growth has rebounded since 2003, bolstered by increases in construction projects and tourism revenues, reflecting its success in the higher-end segment, but the sector faced declining revenues in 2009 with the global economic downturn. The country enjoys one of the highest per capita incomes in the region. Offshore finance and information services are important foreign exchange earners and thrive from having the same time zone as eastern US financial centers and a relatively highly educated workforce. The government continues its efforts to reduce unemployment, to encourage direct foreign investment, and to privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. The public debt-to-GDP ratio rose to over 100% in 2009, largely because a sharp slowdown in tourism and financial services led to a wide budget deficit.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":6227000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":3963000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-0.5% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":78,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":175000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":75,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":10.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":847000000},"expenditures":{"usd":886000000}},"Public debt":"NA% of GDP (2009)","Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":9.25,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1793000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4563000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":4554000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2009)","Industrial production growth rate":"-3.2% (2000 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":1002999999.9999999,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":939900000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":765,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":9000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1750,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":10390,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1790000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":29170000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":29170000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":113300000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-254 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":385000000},"Imports":{"usd":1586000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":620000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":668000000},"Exchange rates":"Barbadian dollars (BBD) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, sugar, light manufacturing, component assembly for export"],"agricultureProducts":["sugarcane","vegetables","cotton"],"exportCommodities":["manufactures","sugar and molasses","rum","other foods and beverages","chemicals","electrical components"],"exportPartners":["Trinidad and Tobago 17.48%","Jamaica 15.63%","US 8.93%","Saint Lucia 8.13%","UK 5.36%","Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 5.04%","Antigua and Barbuda 4.12%"],"importCommodities":["consumer goods","machinery","foodstuffs","construction materials","chemicals","fuel","electrical components"],"importPartners":["Trinidad and Tobago 28.52%","US 27.96%","Colombia 7.13%","China 4.76%","UK 4.39%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":135700,"Telephones - mobile cellular":337100,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"island-wide automatic telephone system","domestic":"fixed-line teledensity of roughly 50 per 100 persons;
