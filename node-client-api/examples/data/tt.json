{"code":"tt","name":"Timor-Leste","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"The Portuguese began to trade with the island of Timor in the early 16th century and colonized it in mid-century. Skirmishing with the Dutch in the region eventually resulted in an 1859 treaty in which Portugal ceded the western portion of the island. Imperial Japan occupied Portuguese Timor from 1942 to 1945, but Portugal resumed colonial authority after the Japanese defeat in World War II. East Timor declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975 and was invaded and occupied by Indonesian forces nine days later. It was incorporated into Indonesia in July 1976 as the province of Timor Timur (East Timor). An unsuccessful campaign of pacification followed over the next two decades, during which an estimated 100,000 to 250,000 individuals lost their lives. On 30 August 1999, in a UN-supervised popular referendum, an overwhelming majority of the people of Timor-Leste voted for independence from Indonesia. Between the referendum and the arrival of a multinational peacekeeping force in late September 1999, anti-independence Timorese militias - organized and supported by the Indonesian military - commenced a large-scale, scorched-earth campaign of retribution. The militias killed approximately 1,400 Timorese and forcibly pushed 300,000 people into western Timor as refugees. Most of the country's infrastructure, including homes, irrigation systems, water supply systems, and schools, and nearly 100% of the country's electrical grid were destroyed. On 20 September 1999, the Australian-led peacekeeping troops of the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) deployed to the country and brought the violence to an end. On 20 May 2002, Timor-Leste was internationally recognized as an independent state. In late April 2006, internal tensions threatened the new nation's security when a military strike led to violence and a near breakdown of law and order. At Dili's request, an Australian-led International Stabilization Force (ISF) deployed to Timor-Leste in late May. In August, the UN Security Council established the UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), which included an authorized police presence of over 1,600 personnel. The ISF and UNMIT restored stability, allowing for presidential and parliamentary elections in April and June 2007 in a largely peaceful atmosphere. In February 2008, a rebel group staged an unsuccessful attack against the president and prime minister. The ringleader was killed in the attack and most of the rebels surrendered in April 2008. Since the unsuccessful attacks the government has enjoyed one of its longest periods of post-independence stability.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Asia, northwest of Australia in the Lesser Sunda Islands at the eastern end of the Indonesian archipelago;

Three hundred thousand people fled westward. Over the next three years a massive international program, manned by 5,000 peacekeepers (8,000 at peak) and 1,300 police officers, led to substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural areas. By the end of 2005, refugees had returned or had settled in Indonesia. The country continues to face great challenges in rebuilding its infrastructure, strengthening the civil administration, and generating jobs for young people entering the work force. The development of oil and gas resources in offshore waters has greatly supplemented government revenues. This technology-intensive industry, however, has done little to create jobs for the unemployed because there are no production facilities in Timor-Leste. Gas is piped to Australia. In June 2005, the National Parliament unanimously approved the creation of a Petroleum Fund to serve as a repository for all petroleum revenues and to preserve the value of Timor-Leste's petroleum wealth for future generations. The Fund held assets of US$6.6 billion as of October 2010. The economy continues to recover strongly from the mid-2006 outbreak of violence and civil unrest, which disrupted both private and public sector economic activity. The government in 2008 resettled tens of thousands of an estimated 100,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs); most IDPs returned home by early 2009. Government spending increased markedly in 2009 and 2010, primarily on basic infrastructure, including electricity and roads. Limited experience in procurement and infrastructure building has hampered these projects. The underlying economic policy challenge the country faces remains how best to use oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth path and to reduce poverty.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":3051000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":628000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":32.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":12.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":55,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":414200,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":90,"unit":"%"},"industry":"NA%","services":"NA% (2006 est.)"},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":42,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":31.3,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":38,"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1481000000},"expenditures":{"usd":838000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7.8,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.17,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":102800000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":268399999.99999997},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":127100000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":"NA kWh (2009 est.)","Electricity - consumption":"NA kWh","Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":96270,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":100900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":553800000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":200000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":1161000000},"Exports":"$10 million (2005 est.);
