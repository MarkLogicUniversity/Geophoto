{"code":"lh","name":"Lithuania","region":"Europe","background":"Lithuanian lands were united under MINDAUGAS in 1236; over the next century, through alliances and conquest, Lithuania extended its territory to include most of present-day Belarus and Ukraine. By the end of the 14th century Lithuania was the largest state in Europe. An alliance with Poland in 1386 led the two countries into a union through the person of a common ruler. In 1569, Lithuania and Poland formally united into a single dual state, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This entity survived until 1795 when its remnants were partitioned by surrounding countries. Lithuania regained its independence following World War I but was annexed by the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US and many other countries. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the first of the Soviet republics to declare its independence, but Moscow did not recognize this proclamation until September of 1991 (following the abortive coup in Moscow). The last Russian troops withdrew in 1993. Lithuania subsequently restructured its economy for integration into Western European institutions; it joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea, between Latvia and Russia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":56,"min":0},"E":{"deg":24,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":65300,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":62680,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":2620,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

Despite Lithuania's EU accession, Lithuania's trade with its Central and Eastern European neighbors, and Russia in particular, accounts for a growing percentage of total trade. Privatization of the large, state-owned utilities is nearly complete. Foreign government and business support have helped in the transition from the old command economy to a market economy. Lithuania's economy grew on average 8% per year for the four years prior to 2008 driven by exports and domestic demand. However, GDP plunged nearly 15% in 2009 - during the 2008-09 crisis the three former Soviet Baltic republics had the world's worst economic declines. In 2009, the government launched a high-profile campaign, led by Prime Minister KUBILIUS, to attract foreign investment and to develop export markets. The current account deficit, which had risen to roughly 15% of GDP in 2007-08, recovered to a surplus of 4% 2009 and 3.4% in 2010 in the wake of a cutback in imports to almost half the 2008 level. Nevertheless, economic growth was flat and unemployment continued upward to 17.9% in 2010.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":56590000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":36360000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4.3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":27.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":68.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1633000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":29.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":56.9,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":17.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":27.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":36,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":15.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":11260000000},"expenditures":{"usd":13480000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":36.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8.39,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":8917000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":17260000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":25350000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":4477000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":12090000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":9612000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":6606000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":5649000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":6333,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":74000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":137200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":204000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":12000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":3530000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":3530000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":1231000000},"Exports":{"usd":19290000000},"Imports":{"usd":20340000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":6418000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":27600000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":14110000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":2507000000},"Exchange rates":"litai (LTL) per US dollar -","industries":["metal-cutting machine tools, electric motors, television sets, refrigerators and freezers, petroleum refining, shipbuilding (small ships), furniture making, textiles, food processing, fertilizers, agricultural machinery, optical equipment, electronic components, computers, amber jewelry"],"agricultureProducts":["grain","potatoes","sugar beets","flax","vegetables","beef","milk","eggs","fish"],"exportCommodities":["mineral products 22%","machinery and equipment 10%","chemicals 9%","textiles 7%","foodstuffs 7%","plastics 7%"],"exportPartners":["Russia 13.2%","Latvia 10%","Germany 9.6%","Poland 7.1%","Estonia 7.1%","Belarus 4.7%","UK 4.3% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["mineral products","machinery and equipment","transport equipment","chemicals","textiles and clothing","metals"],"importPartners":["Russia 30.1%","Germany 11.1%","Poland 9.9%","Latvia 6.3% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":747400,"Telephones - mobile cellular":4962000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"adequate;
