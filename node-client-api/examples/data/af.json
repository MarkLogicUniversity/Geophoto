{"code":"af","name":"Afghanistan","region":"South Asia","background":"Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded Afghanistan in 1747. The country served as a buffer between the British and Russian Empires until it won independence from notional British control in 1919. A brief experiment in democracy ended in a 1973 coup and a 1978 Communist counter-coup. The Soviet Union invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan Communist regime, touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew in 1989 under relentless pressure by internationally supported anti-Communist mujahedin rebels. A series of subsequent civil wars saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the country's civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., a US, Allied, and anti-Taliban Northern Alliance military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering Osama BIN LADIN. The UN-sponsored Bonn Conference in 2001 established a process for political reconstruction that included the adoption of a new constitution, a presidential election in 2004, and National Assembly elections in 2005. In December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan and the National Assembly was inaugurated the following December. KARZAI was re-elected in August 2009 for a second term. Despite gains toward building a stable central government, a resurgent Taliban and continuing provincial instability - particularly in the south and the east - remain serious challenges for the Afghan Government.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Asia, north and west of Pakistan, east of Iran","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":33,"min":0},"E":{"deg":65,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":652230,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":652230,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Texas","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":5529,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"China 76 km, Iran 936 km, Pakistan 2,430 km, Tajikistan 1,206 km, Turkmenistan 744 km, Uzbekistan 137 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"mostly rugged mountains;

The economy has improved significantly since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001 largely because of the infusion of international assistance, the recovery of the agricultural sector, and service sector growth. Despite the progress of the past few years, Afghanistan is extremely poor, landlocked, and highly dependent on foreign aid, agriculture, and trade with neighboring countries. Much of the population continues to suffer from shortages of housing, clean water, electricity, medical care, and jobs. Criminality, insecurity, weak governance, and the Afghan Government's inability to extend rule of law to all parts of the country pose challenges to future economic growth. Afghanistan's living standards are among the lowest in the world. While the international community remains committed to Afghanistan's development, pledging over $67 billion at four donors' conferences since 2002, the Government of Afghanistan will need to overcome a number of challenges, including low revenue collection, anemic job creation, high levels of corruption, weak government capacity, and poor public infrastructure.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":27360000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":15610000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":8.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":31,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":43,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":15000000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":78.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":15.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":35,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":36,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1000000000},"expenditures":{"usd":3300000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":13.3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":3943000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4149000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":363600000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":285500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":231100000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":230000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":5000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4404,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":30000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":30000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":49550000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.475 billion (2009 est.)","Exports":{"Exports":{"usd":547000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Imports":{"usd":5300000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2700000000},"Exchange rates":"afghanis (AFA) per US dollar -","industries":["small-scale production of textiles, soap, furniture, shoes, fertilizer, apparel, food-products, non-alcoholic beverages, mineral water, cement","handwoven carpets","natural gas, coal, copper"],"agricultureProducts":["opium","wheat","fruits","nuts","wool","mutton","sheepskins","lambskins"],"exportCommodities":["opium","fruits and nuts","handwoven carpets","wool","cotton","hides and pelts","precious and semi-precious gems"],"exportPartners":["US 26.47%","India 23.09%","Pakistan 17.36%","Tajikistan 12.51%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and other capital goods","food","textiles","petroleum products"],"importPartners":["Pakistan 26.78%","US 24.81%","India 5.15%","Germany 5.06%","Russia 4.04%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":129300,"Telephones - mobile cellular":12000000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"limited fixed-line telephone service;
