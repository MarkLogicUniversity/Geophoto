{"code":"fr","name":"France","region":"Europe","background":"Although ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II, France suffered extensive losses in its empire, wealth, manpower, and rank as a dominant nation-state. Nevertheless, France today is one of the most modern countries in the world and is a leader among European nations. Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing system resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier more purely parliamentary administrations. In recent decades, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of Europe, including the introduction of a common exchange currency, the euro, in January 1999. In the early 21st century, five French overseas entities - French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Reunion - became French regions and were made part of France proper.","geo":{"Location":{"metropolitan France":"Western Europe, bordering the Bay of Biscay and English Channel, between Belgium and Spain, southeast of the UK;

The government has partially or fully privatized many large companies, banks, and insurers, and has ceded stakes in such leading firms as Air France, France Telecom, Renault, and Thales. It maintains a strong presence in some sectors, particularly power, public transport, and defense industries. With at least 75 million foreign tourists per year, France is the most visited country in the world and maintains the third largest income in the world from tourism. France's leaders remain committed to a capitalism in which they maintain social equity by means of laws, tax policies, and social spending that reduce income disparity and the impact of free markets on public health and welfare. France has weathered the global economic crisis better than most other big EU economies because of the relative resilience of domestic consumer spending, a large public sector, and less exposure to the downturn in global demand than in some other countries. Nonetheless, France's real GDP contracted 2.5% in 2009, but recovered somewhat in 2010, while the unemployment rate increased from 7.4% in 2008 to 9.5% in 2010. The government pursuit of aggressive stimulus and investment measures in response to the economic crisis, however, are contributing to a deterioration of France's public finances. The government budget deficit rose sharply from 3.4% of GDP in 2008 to 7.8% of GDP in 2010, while France's public debt rose from 68% of GDP to 84% over the same period. Paris is terminating stimulus measures, eliminating tax credits, and freezing most government spending to bring the budget deficit under the 3% euro-zone ceiling by 2013, and to highlight France's commitment to fiscal discipline at a time of intense financial market scrutiny of euro zone debt levels. President SARKOZY - who secured passage of pension reform in 2010 - is expected to seek passage of some tax reforms in 2011, but he may delay additional, more costly, reforms until after the 2012 election.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":2145000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":2583000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":19.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":79,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":28210000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":71.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":9.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":6.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":24.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":32.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1241000000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1441000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":83.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":7.46,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":858600000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2292000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":4319000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1972000000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":535700000000.00006,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":447200000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":58690000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":10680000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":70820,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1875000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":597800,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2386000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":101200000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":877000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":44840000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":1931000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":45850000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":7079000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-53.29 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":508700000000},"Imports":{"usd":577700000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":4698000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":1207000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1837000000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["machinery, chemicals, automobiles, metallurgy, aircraft, electronics","textiles, food processing","tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","cereals","sugar beets","potatoes","wine grapes","beef","dairy products","fish"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and transportation equipment","aircraft","plastics","chemicals","pharmaceutical products","iron and steel","beverages"],"exportPartners":["Germany 15.88%","Italy 8.16%","Spain 7.8%","Belgium 7.44%","UK 7.04%","US 5.65%","Netherlands 3.99%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","vehicles","crude oil","aircraft","plastics","chemicals"],"importPartners":["Germany 19.41%","Belgium 11.61%","Italy 7.97%","Netherlands 7.15%","Spain 6.68%","UK 4.9%","US 4.72%","China 4.44%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":"36.441 million;
