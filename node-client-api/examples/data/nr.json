{"code":"nr","name":"Nauru","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"The exact origins of the Nauruans are unclear since their language does not resemble any other in the Pacific. Germany annexed the island in 1888. A German-British consortium began mining the island's phosphate deposits early in the 20th century. Australian forces occupied Nauru in World War I; it subsequently became a League of Nations mandate. After the Second World War - and a brutal occupation by Japan - Nauru became a UN trust territory. It achieved independence in 1968 and joined the UN in 1999 as the world's smallest independent republic.","geo":{"Location":"Oceania, island in the South Pacific Ocean, south of the Marshall Islands","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":0,"min":32},"E":{"deg":166,"min":55}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":21,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":21,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"about 0.1 times the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":30,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"sandy beach rises to fertile ring around raised coral reefs with phosphate plateau in center","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"unnamed elevation along plateau rim 61 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":"NA","Natural hazards":"periodic droughts","internationalEnvironmentAgreements":{"signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements","partyTo":["Biodiversity","Climate Change","Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol","Desertification","Hazardous Wastes","Law of the Sea","Marine Dumping","Ozone Layer Protection","Whaling"]},"naturalResources":["phosphates","fish"],"environmentalIssues":["limited natural freshwater resources, roof storage tanks collect rainwater but mostly dependent on a single, aging desalination plant","intensive phosphate mining during the past 90 years - mainly by a UK, Australia, and NZ consortium - has left the central 90% of Nauru a wasteland and threatens limited remaining land resources"],"climate":["tropical with a monsoonal pattern","rainy season (November to February)"],"geographyNote":["Nauru is one of the three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific Ocean - the others are Banaba (Ocean Island) in Kiribati and Makatea in French Polynesia","only 53 km south of Equator"]},"people":{"Population":9322,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":33,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":65.3,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"1.6% (male 68/female 85) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":24.2,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":24.4,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":23.9,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":0.611,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":27.78,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":6.11,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":"-15.55 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2011 est.)","Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":100,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":0.6,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":{"quantity":0.837,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years":{"quantity":1.04,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":0.97,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over":{"quantity":1,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population":{"quantity":0.99,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":{"quantity":8.66,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":11.15,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"female":{"quantity":6.58,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"}},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":{"quantity":65.35,"unit":"years"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":61.27,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":68.75,"unit":"years"}},"Total fertility rate":{"quantity":3.08,"unit":"children born/woman"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":"NA","HIV/AIDS - deaths":"NA","Drinking water source":{},"Sanitation facility access":{},"Nationality":{"noun":"Nauruan(s)","adjective":"Nauruan"},"Literacy":"NA","School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":{"quantity":9,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":9,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":10,"unit":"years"}},"Education expenditures":"NA","ethnicGroups":["Nauruan 58%","other Pacific Islander 26%","Chinese 8%","European 8%"],"religions":["Nauru Congregational 35.4%","Roman Catholic 33.2%","Nauru Independent Church 10.4%","other 14.1%","none 4.5%","unspecified 2.4% (2002 census)"],"languages":["Nauruan (official","a distinct Pacific Island language)","English (widely understood","spoken","and used for most government and commercial purposes)"]},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"Republic of Nauru","conventional short form":"Nauru","local long form":"Republic of Nauru","local short form":"Nauru","former":"Pleasant Island"},"Government type":"republic","Capital":{"Capital":"no official capital;

Few other resources exist, with most necessities being imported, mainly from Australia, its former occupier and later major source of support. In 2005 an Australian company entered into an agreement to exploit remaining supplies. Primary reserves of phosphates were exhausted and mining ceased in 2006, but mining of a deeper layer of \"secondary phosphate\" in the interior of the island began the following year. The secondary phosphate deposits may last another 30 years. The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems. In anticipation of the exhaustion of Nauru's phosphate deposits, substantial amounts of phosphate income were invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition and provide for Nauru's economic future. As a result of heavy spending from the trust funds, the government faced virtual bankruptcy. To cut costs the government has frozen wages and reduced overstaffed public service departments. Nauru lost further revenue in 2008 with the closure of Australia's refugee processing center, making it almost totally dependent on food imports and foreign aid. Housing, hospitals, and other capital plant are deteriorating. The cost to Australia of keeping the government and economy afloat continues to climb. Few comprehensive statistics on the Nauru economy exist with estimates of Nauru's GDP varying widely.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":60000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":"$NA","GDP - real growth rate":"NA%","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":"NA%"},"Labor force - by occupation":{"note":"employed in mining phosphates, public administration, education, and transportation (1992)"},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":90,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":13500000},"expenditures":{"usd":13500000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"NA%","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":31000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":28830000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1026,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":null},"Imports":{"usd":20000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":33299999.999999996},"Exchange rates":"Australian dollars (AUD) per US dollar -","industries":["phosphate mining, offshore banking, coconut products"],"agricultureProducts":["coconuts"],"exportCommodities":["phosphates"],"importCommodities":["food","fuel","manufactures","building materials","machinery"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1900,"Telephones - mobile cellular":1500,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"adequate local and international radiotelephone communication provided via Australian facilities","domestic":"NA","international":"country code - 674; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean)"},"Broadcast media":"1 government-owned television station broadcasting programs from New Zealand sent via satellite or on videotape; 1 government-owned radio station, broadcasting on AM and FM, utilizes Australian and British programs (2009)","Internet country code":".nr","Internet hosts":4158},"transport":{"Airports":1,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":1,"1,524 to 2,437 m":1},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":24,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":24,"unit":"km"}},"Ports and terminals":"Nauru"},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces; Nauru Police Force (2009)","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":2542},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":1823,"females age 16-49":2034},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":74,"female":78},"Military expenditures":"NA","Military - note":"Nauru maintains no defense forces; under an informal agreement, defense is the responsibility of Australia"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
