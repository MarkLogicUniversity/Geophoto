{"code":"ek","name":"Equatorial Guinea","region":"Africa","background":"Equatorial Guinea gained independence in 1968 after 190 years of Spanish rule. This tiny country, composed of a mainland portion plus five inhabited islands, is one of the smallest on the African continent. President Teodoro OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO has ruled the country since 1979 when he seized power in a coup. Although nominally a constitutional democracy since 1991, the 1996, 2002, and 2009 presidential elections - as well as the 1999, 2004, and 2008 legislative elections - were widely seen as flawed. The president exerts almost total control over the political system and has discouraged political opposition. Equatorial Guinea has experienced rapid economic growth due to the discovery of large offshore oil reserves, and in the last decade has become Sub-Saharan Africa's third largest oil exporter. Despite the country's economic windfall from oil production resulting in a massive increase in government revenue in recent years, improvements in the population's living standards have been slow to develop.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the Bight of Biafra, between Cameroon and Gabon","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":2,"min":0},"E":{"deg":10,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":28051,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":28051,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Maryland","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":539,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Cameroon 189 km, Gabon 350 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":296,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"coastal plains rise to interior hills;

Forestry and farming are also minor components of GDP. Subsistence farming is the dominate form of livelihood. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect of the rural economy under successive regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led growth (the government has stated its intention to reinvest some oil revenue into agriculture). A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement. The government has been widely criticized for its lack of transparency and misuse of oil revenues; however, in 2010, under Equatorial Guinea's candidacy in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, the government published oil revenue figures for the first time. Undeveloped natural resources include gold, zinc, diamonds, columbite-tantalite, and other base metals. Growth remained strong in 2008, when oil production peaked, but slowed in 2009-10, as the price of oil and the production level fell.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":23820000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":14490000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-0.8% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":93.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":195200,"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":22.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":29.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":6739000000},"expenditures":{"usd":6984000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":8.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1860000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2207000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1534000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":28000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":26040000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":346000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":362900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1114,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1100000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":6670000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":1500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":5170000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":36810000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.477 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":10240000000},"Imports":{"usd":5743000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":4086000000.0000005},"Debt - external":{"usd":832000000},"Exchange rates":"Cooperation Financiere en Afrique Centrale francs per US dollar -","industries":["petroleum, natural gas, sawmilling"],"agricultureProducts":["coffee","cocoa","rice","yams","cassava (tapioca)","bananas","palm oil nuts","livestock","timber"],"exportCommodities":["petroleum products","timber"],"exportPartners":["US 30.31%","China 12.54%","Japan 9.21%","Spain 7.5%","South Korea 7.01%","Taiwan 5.63%","Italy 5.38%","Netherlands 4.09%"],"importCommodities":["petroleum sector equipment","other equipment","construction materials","vehicles"],"importPartners":["China 19.97%","US 17.28%","Spain 14.94%","France 9.49%","Cote d'Ivoire 6.34%","Italy 5.02%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":10000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":445000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"digital fixed-line network in most major urban areas and good mobile coverage","domestic":"fixed-line density is about 2 per 100 persons;
