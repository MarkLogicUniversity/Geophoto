{"code":"wi","name":"Western Sahara","region":"Africa","background":"Morocco annexed the northern two-thirds of Western Sahara (formerly Spanish Sahara) in 1976 and claimed the rest of the territory in 1979, following Mauritania's withdrawal. A guerrilla war with the Polisario Front contesting Morocco's sovereignty ended in a 1991 UN-brokered cease-fire; a UN-organized referendum on the territory's final status has been repeatedly postponed. The UN since 2007 has sponsored intermittent talks between representatives of the Government of Morocco and the Polisario Front to negotiate the status of Western Sahara. Morocco has put forward an autonomy proposal for the territory, which would allow for some local administration while maintaining Moroccan sovereignty. The Polisario, with Algeria's support, demands a popular referendum that includes the option of independence.","geo":{"Location":"Northern Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Mauritania and Morocco","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":24,"min":30},"W":{"deg":13,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":266000,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":266000,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"about the size of Colorado","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":2046,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Algeria 42 km, Mauritania 1,561 km, Morocco 443 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1110,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"contingent upon resolution of sovereignty issue","Terrain":"mostly low, flat desert with large areas of rocky or sandy surfaces rising to small mountains in south and northeast","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Sebjet Tah -55 m","highest point":"unnamed elevation 805 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0.02,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":99.98,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":"NA","Natural hazards":"hot, dry, dust/sand-laden sirocco wind can occur during winter and spring;

The territory's arid desert climate makes sedentary agriculture difficult, and Western Sahara imports much of its food. The Moroccan Government administers Western Sahara's economy and is a source of employment, infrastructure development, and social spending in the territory. Western Sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between Morocco and the Polisario. Morocco and the EU in July 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing European vessels to fish off the coast of Morocco, including the disputed waters off the coast of Western Sahara. Oil has never been found in Western Sahara in commercially significant quantities, but Morocco and the Polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory. Western Sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":900000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":"$NA","GDP - real growth rate":"NA%","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":144000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":"$NA","expenditures":"$NA"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"NA%","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":90000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":83700000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1702,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":"$NA","Imports":"$NA","Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Moroccan dirhams (MAD) per US dollar -","industries":["phosphate mining, handicrafts"],"agricultureProducts":["fruits and vegetables (grown in the few oases)","camels","sheep","goats (kept by nomads)","fish"],"exportCommodities":["phosphates 62%"],"importCommodities":["fuel for fishing fleet","foodstuffs"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":"about 2,000 (1999 est.)","Telephones - mobile cellular":0,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"sparse and limited system","domestic":"NA","international":"country code - 212; tied into Morocco's system by microwave radio relay, tropospheric scatter, and satellite; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) linked to Rabat, Morocco"},"Broadcast media":"Morocco's state-owned broadcaster, Radio-Television Marocaine (RTM), operates a radio service from Laayoune and relays TV service; a Polisario-backed radio station also broadcasts (2008)","Internet country code":".eh"},"transport":{"Airports":6,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":3,"2,438 to 3,047 m":3},"Airports - with unpaved runways":{"total":3,"1,524 to 2,437 m":1,"914 to 1,523 m":1,"under 914 m":1},"Ports and terminals":"Ad Dakhla, Laayoune (El Aaiun)"},"military":{"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":79489,"females age 16-49":87362},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":5523,"female":5429}},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["Many neighboring states reject Moroccan administration of Western Sahara","several states have extended diplomatic relations to the \"Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic\" represented by the Polisario Front in exile in Algeria, while others recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara","most of the approximately 102,000 Sahrawi refugees are sheltered in camps in Tindouf, Algeria"]}}
