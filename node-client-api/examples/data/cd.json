{"code":"cd","name":"Chad","region":"Africa","background":"Chad, part of France's African holdings until 1960, endured three decades of civil warfare as well as invasions by Libya before a semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990. The government eventually drafted a democratic constitution and held flawed presidential elections in 1996 and 2001. In 1998, a rebellion broke out in northern Chad, which has sporadically flared up despite several peace agreements between the government and the rebels. In 2005, new rebel groups emerged in western Sudan and made probing attacks into eastern Chad despite signing peace agreements in December 2006 and October 2007. Power remains in the hands of an ethnic minority. In June 2005, President Idriss DEBY held a referendum successfully removing constitutional term limits and won another controversial election in 2006. Sporadic rebel campaigns continued throughout 2006 and 2007. The capital experienced a significant rebel threat in early 2008.","geo":{"Location":"Central Africa, south of Libya","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":15,"min":0},"E":{"deg":19,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":1284000,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":1259,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":24800,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than three times the size of California","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":5968,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Cameroon 1,094 km, Central African Republic 1,197 km, Libya 1,055 km, Niger 1,175 km, Nigeria 87 km, Sudan 1,360 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"broad, arid plains in center, desert in north, mountains in northwest, lowlands in south","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Djourab 160 m","highest point":"Emi Koussi 3,415 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.02,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":97.18,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":300,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":43,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":0.23,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":24,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"hot, dry, dusty harmattan winds occur in north;

At least 80% of Chad's population relies on subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood. Chad's economy has long been handicapped by its landlocked position, high energy costs, and a history of instability. Chad relies on foreign assistance and foreign capital for most public and private sector investment projects. A consortium led by two US companies has been investing $3.7 billion to develop oil reserves - estimated at 1 billion barrels - in southern Chad. Chinese companies are also expanding exploration efforts and are currently building a 300-km pipeline and the country's first refinery. The nation's total oil reserves are estimated at 1.5 billion barrels. Oil production came on stream in late 2003. Chad began to export oil in 2004. Cotton, cattle, and gum arabic provide the bulk of Chad's non-oil export earnings.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":17360000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":7848000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":50.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":42.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4293000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":30.8,"unit":"%"}},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":14.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1972000000},"expenditures":{"usd":2859000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":920900000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1257000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":943800000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":93000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":115000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":157900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1571,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1500000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.6 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":3036000000},"Imports":{"usd":2631000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":868000000},"Debt - external":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Cooperation Financiere en Afrique Centrale francs (XAF) per US dollar -","industries":["oil, cotton textiles, meatpacking, brewing, natron (sodium carbonate), soap, cigarettes, construction materials"],"agricultureProducts":["cotton","sorghum","millet","peanuts","rice","potatoes","manioc (tapioca)","cattle","sheep","goats","camels"],"exportCommodities":["oil","cattle","cotton","gum arabic"],"exportPartners":["US 90.06%","France 4.81%","China 1.6%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transportation equipment","industrial goods","foodstuffs","textiles"],"importPartners":["France 17.74%","Cameroon 12.7%","China 11.23%","US 7.59%","Italy 6.54%","Ukraine 5.33%","Netherlands 4.37%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":13000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2686000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"inadequate system of radiotelephone communication stations with high costs and low telephone density","domestic":"fixed-line connections for only about 1 per 1000 persons coupled with mobile-cellular subscribership base of only about 25 per 100 persons","international":"country code - 235;
