{"code":"ns","name":"Suriname","region":"South America","background":"First explored by the Spaniards in the 16th century and then settled by the English in the mid-17th century, Suriname became a Dutch colony in 1667. With the abolition of slavery in 1863, workers were brought in from India and Java. Independence from the Netherlands was granted in 1975. Five years later the civilian government was replaced by a military regime that soon declared a socialist republic. It continued to exert control through a succession of nominally civilian administrations until 1987, when international pressure finally forced a democratic election. In 1990, the military overthrew the civilian leadership, but a democratically elected government - a four-party coalition - returned to power in 1991. The coalition expanded to eight parties in 2005 and ruled until August 2010, when voters returned former military leader Desire BOUTERSE and his opposition coalition to power.","geo":{"Location":"Northern South America, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between French Guiana and Guyana","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":4,"min":0},"W":{"deg":56,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":163820,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":156000,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":7820,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

In 2000, the government of Ronald VENETIAAN, returned to office and inherited an economy with inflation of over 100% and a growing fiscal deficit. He quickly implemented an austerity program, raised taxes, attempted to control spending, and tamed inflation. Economic growth reached about 7% in 2008, owing to sizeable foreign investment in mining and oil. Suriname has received aid for projects in the bauxite and gold mining sectors from Netherlands, Belgium, and the European Development Fund. The economy slowed in 2009, however, as investment waned and the country earned less from its commodity exports when global prices for most commodities fell. Trade picked up, boosting Suriname's economic growth in 2010, but the government's budget remained strained, with increased social spending during the election. In January 2011, the government devalued the currency by 20% and raised taxes to reduce the budget deficit. Suriname's economic prospects for the medium term will depend on continued commitment to responsible monetary and fiscal policies and to the introduction of structural reforms to liberalize markets and promote competition.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":4711000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":3682000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":10.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":64.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":165600,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":78,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":9.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":392600000},"expenditures":{"usd":425900000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6.4,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.65,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":608000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1809000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":793100000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1605000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":1467000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":15190,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":14000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":4308,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":6296,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":79600000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":24000000},"Exports":{"usd":1391000000},"Imports":{"usd":1297000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":263300000},"Debt - external":{"usd":504300000},"Exchange rates":"Surinamese dollars (SRD) per US dollar -","industries":["bauxite and gold mining, alumina production","oil, lumbering, food processing, fishing"],"agricultureProducts":["paddy rice","bananas","palm kernels","coconuts","plantains","peanuts","beef","chickens","shrimp","forest products"],"exportCommodities":["alumina","gold","crude oil","lumber","shrimp and fish","rice","bananas"],"exportPartners":["Canada 35.47%","Belgium 14.92%","US 10.15%","UAE 9.87%","Norway 4.92%","Netherlands 4.7%","France 4.47%"],"importCommodities":["capital equipment","petroleum","foodstuffs","cotton","consumer goods"],"importPartners":["US 30.79%","Netherlands 19.17%","Trinidad and Tobago 13.04%","China 6.8%","Japan 5.85%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":83700,"Telephones - mobile cellular":763900,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"international facilities are good","domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity roughly 175 telephones per 100 persons;
