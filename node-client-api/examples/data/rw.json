{"code":"rw","name":"Rwanda","region":"Africa","background":"In 1959, three years before independence from Belgium, the majority ethnic group, the Hutus, overthrew the ruling Tutsi king. Over the next several years, thousands of Tutsis were killed, and some 150,000 driven into exile in neighboring countries. The children of these exiles later formed a rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), and began a civil war in 1990. The war, along with several political and economic upheavals, exacerbated ethnic tensions, culminating in April 1994 in a state-orchestrated genocide, in which Rwandans killed up to a million of their fellow citizens, including approximately three-quarters of the Tutsi population. The genocide ended later that same year when the predominantly Tutsi RPF, operating out of Uganda and northern Rwanda, defeated the national army and Hutu militias, and established an RPF-led government of national unity. Approximately 2 million Hutu refugees - many fearing Tutsi retribution - fled to neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire. Since then, most of the refugees have returned to Rwanda, but several thousand remained in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC; the former Zaire) and formed an extremist insurgency bent on retaking Rwanda, much as the RPF tried in 1990. Rwanda held its first local elections in 1999 and its first post-genocide presidential and legislative elections in 2003. Rwanda in 2009 staged a joint military operation with the Congolese Army in DRC to rout out the Hutu extremist insurgency there and Kigali and Kinshasa restored diplomatic relations. Rwanda also joined the Commonwealth in late 2009.","geo":{"Location":"Central Africa, east of Democratic Republic of the Congo","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":2,"min":0},"E":{"deg":30,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":26338,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":24668,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":1670,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Maryland","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":893,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Burundi 290 km, Democratic Republic of the Congo 217 km, Tanzania 217 km, Uganda 169 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"mostly grassy uplands and hills;

Tourism is now Rwanda's primary foreign exchange earner and in 2008, minerals overtook coffee and tea as Rwanda's primary export. Minerals exports declined 40% in 2009-10 due to the global economic downturn. The 1994 genocide decimated Rwanda's fragile economic base, severely impoverished the population, particularly women, and temporarily stalled the country's ability to attract private and external investment. However, Rwanda has made substantial progress in stabilizing and rehabilitating its economy to pre-1994 levels. GDP has rebounded with an average annual growth of 7-8% since 2003 and inflation has been reduced to single digits. Nonetheless, a significant percent of the population still live below the official poverty line. Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not keep pace with demand, requiring food imports. Agricultural production has increased significantly over the last three years and last year Rwanda was self sufficient in food production. Rwanda continues to receive substantial aid money and obtained IMF-World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative debt relief in 2005-06. In recognition of Rwanda's successful management of its macro economy, in 2010, the IMF graduated Rwanda to a Policy Support Instrument (PSI). Rwanda also received a Millennium Challenge Threshold Program in 2008. Africa's most densely populated country is trying to overcome the limitations of its small, landlocked economy by leveraging regional trade. Rwanda joined the East African Community and is aligning its budget, trade, and immigration policies with its regional partners. The government has embraced an expansionary fiscal policy to reduce poverty by improving education, infrastructure, and foreign and domestic investment and pursuing market-oriented reforms. Energy shortages, instability in neighboring states, and lack of adequate transportation linkages to other countries continue to handicap private sector growth. The Rwandan government is seeking to become regional leader in information and communication technologies. In 2010, Rwanda neared completion of the first modern Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Kigali. The SEZ seeks to attract investment in all sectors, but specifically in agribusiness, information and communications technologies, trade and logistics, mining, and construction. The global downturn hurt export demand and tourism, but economic growth is recovering, driven in large part by the services sector, and inflation has been contained. On the back of this growth, government is gradually ending its fiscal stimulus policy while protecting aid to the poor.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":12160000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5622000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":42.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":14.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":43.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4446000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":90,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":60,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":38.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":46.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1169000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1366000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":11.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA% (31 December 2010)","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":602300000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1243000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":600400000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":120000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":231600000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":10000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":130000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":6000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":5623,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":56630000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-489 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":226000000},"Imports":{"usd":1046999999.9999999},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":816000000},"Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Rwandan francs (RWF) per US dollar -","industries":["cement, agricultural products, small-scale beverages, soap, furniture, shoes, plastic goods, textiles, cigarettes"],"agricultureProducts":["coffee","tea","pyrethrum (insecticide made from chrysanthemums)","bananas","beans","sorghum","potatoes","livestock"],"exportCommodities":["coffee","tea","hides","tin ore"],"exportPartners":["Kenya 33.88%","Democratic Republic of the Congo 13.56%","Thailand 6.22%","China 5.49%","US 5.47%","Swaziland 5.43%","Belgium 5.19%"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","machinery and equipment","steel","petroleum products","cement and construction material"],"importPartners":["Kenya 16.53%","Uganda 14.92%","China 7.92%","UAE 6.89%","Belgium 5.54%","Germany 5.19%","Tanzania 4.81%","Sweden 4%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":33500,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2429000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"small, inadequate telephone system primarily serves business, education, and government","domestic":"the capital, Kigali, is connected to the centers of the provinces by microwave radio relay and, recently, by cellular telephone service;
