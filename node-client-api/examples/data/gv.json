{"code":"gv","name":"Guinea","region":"Africa","background":"Guinea has had a history of authoritarian rule since gaining its independence from France in 1958. Lansana CONTE came to power in 1984 when the military seized the government after the death of the first president, Sekou TOURE. Guinea did not hold democratic elections until 1993 when Gen. CONTE (head of the military government) was elected president of the civilian government. He was reelected in 1998 and again in 2003, though all the polls were marred by irregularities. History repeated itself in December 2008 when following President CONTE's death, Capt. Moussa Dadis CAMARA led a military coup, seizing power and suspending the constitution. His unwillingness to yield to domestic and international pressure to step down led to heightened political tensions that culminated in September 2009 when presidential guards opened fire on an opposition rally killing more than 150 people, and in early December 2009 when CAMARA was wounded in an assassination attempt and evacuated to Morocco and subsequently to Burkina Faso. A transitional government led by General Sekouba KONATE held democratic elections in 2010 and Alpha CONDE was elected president in the country's first free and fair elections since independence.\r\n\r\n","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":11,"min":0},"W":{"deg":10,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":245857,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":245717,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":140,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

The country has almost half of the world's bauxite reserves and significant iron ore, gold, and diamond reserves. However, Guinea has been unable to profit from this potential, as rampant corruption, dilapidated electricity and other degraded infrastructure, and political uncertainty have drained investor confidence. In the time since a 2008 coup following the death of long-term President Lansana CONTE, international donors, including the G-8, the IMF, and the World Bank, have significantly curtailed their development programs. Throughout 2009, policies of the ruling military junta severely weakened the economy. The junta leaders spent and printed money at an accelerated rate, driving inflation and debt to perilously high levels. In early 2010, the junta collapsed and was replaced by a Transition Government, which ceded power in December 2010 to the country's first-ever democratically elected president, Alpha CONDE. International assistance and investment are expected to return to Guinea, but the levels will depend upon the ability of the new government to combat corruption and reform its banking system. IMF and World Bank programs will be especially critical as Guinea attempts to gain debt relief. Since the 2009 global economic downturn, the price and value of bauxite and alumina exports has steadily risen. Export levels will likely continue to grow as investor confidence returns. International investors have expressed keen interest in Guinea's vast iron ore reserves, which could further propel the country's growth.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":10810000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":4633000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":25.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":45.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":28.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4392000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":76,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":47,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":41,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":38.1,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":14.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":574100000},"expenditures":{"usd":875400000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":496200000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":830000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":734400000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"Electricity - production":{"quantity":850000000,"unit":"kWh"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":790500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":9000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":8674,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-434 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1468000000},"Imports":{"usd":1551000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":3072000000},"Exchange rates":"Guinean francs (GNF) per US dollar -","industries":["bauxite, gold, diamonds, iron","alumina refining","light manufacturing, and agricultural processing"],"agricultureProducts":["rice","coffee","pineapples","palm kernels","cassava (tapioca)","bananas","sweet potatoes","cattle","sheep","goats","timber"],"exportCommodities":["bauxite","alumina","gold","diamonds","coffee","fish","agricultural products"],"exportPartners":["India 19.68%","Spain 13.18%","Russia 7.24%","Germany 6.86%","Ireland 5.87%","US 5.71%","Ukraine 5.6%"],"importCommodities":["petroleum products","metals","machinery","transport equipment","textiles","grain and other foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["China 8.67%","Netherlands 6.67%","France 4.33%","UK 4.22%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":22000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":5607000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"inadequate system of open-wire lines, small radiotelephone communication stations, and new microwave radio relay system","domestic":"Conakry reasonably well served;
