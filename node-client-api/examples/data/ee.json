Internationally, the EU aims to bolster Europe's trade position and its political and economic power. Because of the great differences in per capita income among member states (from $7,000 to $78,000) and in national attitudes toward issues like inflation, debt, and foreign trade, the EU faces difficulties in devising and enforcing common policies. Eleven established EU member states, under the auspices of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), introduced the euro as their common currency on 1 January 1999 (Greece did so two years later), but the UK and Denmark have 'opt-outs' that allow them to keep their national currencies, and Sweden has not taken the steps needed to participate. Between 2004 and 2007, the EU admitted 12 countries that are, in general, less advanced economically than the other 15. Of the 12 most recent member states, only Slovenia (1 January 2007), Cyprus and Malta (1 January 2008), Slovakia (1 January 2009), and Estonia (1 January 2011) have adopted the euro; the remaining states other than the UK and Denmark are legally required to adopt the currency upon meeting EU's fiscal and monetary convergence criteria. The EU has recovered from the global financial crisis faster than expected, with business investment growing by an estimated 2% in 2010, but with public investment and housing development lagging. Strong corporate profits should enable this recovery to continue in 2011. Nevertheless, significant risks to growth remain, including, high official debts and deficits, aging populations, over-regulation of non-financial businesses, and doubts about the sustainability of the EMU. In June 2010, prompted by the Greek financial crisis, the EU and the IMF set up a $1 trillion bailout fund to rescue any EMU member in danger of default, but it has not calmed market jitters that have diminished the value of the euro. Discussions are currently under way to create a permanent European Stabilization Mechanism (ESM) in 2013, when the existing European Financial Stability Facility expires.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":14820000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":16070000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":73.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":225300000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":27.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":66.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":9.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"note - see individual country entries of member states","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":25.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":30.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":7.52,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":5542000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"Stock of broad money":{"usd":11170000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of domestic credit":{"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":22650000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":9903000000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":3078000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2901000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":"NA kWh","Electricity - imports":"NA kWh","Oil - production":{"quantity":2365000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":13630000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2196000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":8613000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":5453000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":181600000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":487900000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":"NA cu m","Natural gas - imports":"NA cu m","Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":2250000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$NA (2010)","Exports":{"Exports":{"usd":1952000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Imports":{"Imports":{"usd":1690000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA","Debt - external":{"Debt - external":{"usd":13720000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Exchange rates":"euros per US dollar -","industries":["among the world's largest and most technologically advanced, the EU industrial base includes: ferrous and non-ferrous metal production and processing, metal products, petroleum, coal, cement, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, rail transportation equipment, passenger and commercial vehicles, construction equipment, industrial equipment, shipbuilding, electrical power equipment, machine tools and automated manufacturing systems, electronics and telecommunications equipment, fishing, food and beverage processing, furniture, paper, textiles, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","barley","oilseeds","sugar beets","wine","grapes","dairy products","cattle","sheep","pigs","poultry","fish"],"exportCommodities":["machinery","motor vehicles","aircraft","plastics","pharmaceuticals and other chemicals","fuels","iron and steel","nonferrous metals","wood pulp and paper products","textiles","meat","dairy products","fish","alcoholic beverages"],"importCommodities":["machinery","vehicles","aircraft","plastics","crude oil","chemicals","textiles","metals","foodstuffs","clothing"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":238000000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":466000000,"Telephone system":"note - see individual country entries of member states","Internet country code":".eu;
