Invasions by Norsemen that began in the late 8th century were finally ended when King Brian BORU defeated the Danes in 1014. English invasions began in the 12th century and set off more than seven centuries of Anglo-Irish struggle marked by fierce rebellions and harsh repressions. A failed 1916 Easter Monday Rebellion touched off several years of guerrilla warfare that in 1921 resulted in independence from the UK for 26 southern counties; six northern (Ulster) counties remained part of the UK. In 1949, Ireland withdrew from the British Commonwealth; it joined the European Community in 1973. Irish governments have sought the peaceful unification of Ireland and have cooperated with Britain against terrorist groups. A peace settlement for Northern Ireland is gradually being implemented despite some difficulties. In 2006, the Irish and British governments developed and began to implement the St. Andrews Agreement, building on the Good Friday Agreement approved in 1998.","geo":{"Location":"Western Europe, occupying five-sixths of the island of Ireland in the North Atlantic Ocean, west of Great Britain","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":53,"min":0},"W":{"deg":8,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":70273,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":68883,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":1390,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than West Virginia","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":360,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"UK 360 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1448,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive fishing zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"mostly level to rolling interior plain surrounded by rugged hills and low mountains;

Ireland was among the initial group of 12 EU nations that began circulating the euro on 1 January 2002. GDP growth averaged 6% in 1995-2007, but economic activity has dropped sharply since the onset of the world financial crisis, with GDP falling by over 3% in 2008, nearly 8% in 2009, and 1% in 2010. Ireland entered into a recession in 2008 for the first time in more than a decade, with the subsequent collapse of its domestic property and construction markets. Property prices rose more rapidly in Ireland in the decade up to 2007 than in any other developed economy. Since their 2007 peak, average house prices have fallen 50%. In the wake of the collapse of the construction sector and the downturn in consumer spending and business investment, the export sector, dominated by foreign multinationals, has become a key component of Ireland's economy. Agriculture, once the most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry and services. In 2008 the COWEN government moved to guarantee all bank deposits, recapitalize the banking system, and establish partly-public venture capital funds in response to the country's economic downturn. In 2009, in continued efforts to stabilize the banking sector, the Irish Government established the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) to acquire problem commercial property and development loans from Irish banks. Faced with sharply reduced revenues and a burgeoning budget deficit, the Irish Government introduced the first in a series of draconian budgets in 2009. In addition to across-the-board cuts in spending, the 2009 budget included wage reductions for all public servants. These measures were not sufficient. The budget deficit reached nearly 32% of GDP in 2010 because of additional government support for the banking sector. In late 2010, the COWEN Government agreed to a $112 billion loan package from the EU and IMF to help Dublin further increase the capitalization of its banking sector and avoid defaulting on its sovereign debt. The government also initiated a four-year austerity plan to cut an additional $20 billion from its budget. A return to modest growth is expected in 2011.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":172300000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":204300000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-1% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":29,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2150000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":76,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":13.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":27.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":29.3,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":16.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":68700000000},"expenditures":{"usd":135100000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":94.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"-1.6% (2010 est.)","Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":127700000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":257100000000.00003},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":745700000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":63100000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":27280000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":26990000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":290000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":756000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":160900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":19270,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":181600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":392000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":4999000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":4628000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":9911000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-3.191 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":115700000000},"Imports":{"usd":70360000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2104000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2253000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":228000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":286200000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["pharmaceuticals, chemicals, computer hardware and software, food products, beverages and brewing","medical devices"],"agricultureProducts":["beef","dairy products","barley","potatoes","wheat"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and equipment","computers","chemicals","pharmaceuticals","live animals","animal products"],"exportPartners":["US 20.52%","Belgium 17.78%","UK 16.31%","Germany 5.66%","France 5.56%","Spain 4.19%"],"importCommodities":["data processing equipment","other machinery and equipment","chemicals","petroleum and petroleum products","textiles","clothing"],"importPartners":["UK 35.28%","US 16.87%","Germany 6.76%","Netherlands 5.86%","France 4.76%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":2080000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":4871000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern digital system using cable and microwave radio relay","domestic":"system privatized but dominated by former state monopoly operator;
