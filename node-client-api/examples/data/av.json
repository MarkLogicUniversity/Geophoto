Several attempts at separation failed. In 1971, two years after a revolt, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede; this arrangement was formally recognized in 1980 with Anguilla becoming a separate British dependency.","geo":{"Location":"Caribbean, islands between the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean, east of Puerto Rico","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":18,"min":15},"W":{"deg":63,"min":10}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":91,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":91,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"about one-half the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":61,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":3,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive fishing zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"flat and low-lying island of coral and limestone","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caribbean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Crocus Hill 65 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":"100% (mostly rock with sparse scrub oak, few trees, some commercial salt ponds) (2005)"},"Irrigated land":"NA","Natural hazards":"frequent hurricanes and other tropical storms (July to October)","naturalResources":["salt","fish","lobster"],"environmentalIssues":["supplies of potable water sometimes cannot meet increasing demand largely because of poor distribution system"],"climate":["tropical","moderated by northeast trade winds"],"geographyNote":["the most northerly of the Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles"]},"people":{"Population":15094,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":68.1,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"7.9% (male 577/female 610) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":33.3,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":31.9,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":34.7,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":2.173,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":12.92,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":4.44,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":{"quantity":13.25,"unit":"migrant(s)/1,000 population"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":100,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Major cities - population":"THE VALLEY (capital) 2,000 (2009)","Sex ratio":{"at birth":{"quantity":1.031,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years":{"quantity":1.05,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over":{"quantity":0.93,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population":{"quantity":0.94,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":{"quantity":3.47,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":3.91,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"female":{"quantity":3.01,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"}},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":{"quantity":80.87,"unit":"years"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":78.32,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":83.51,"unit":"years"}},"Total fertility rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"children born/woman"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":"NA","HIV/AIDS - deaths":"NA","Drinking water source":{},"Sanitation facility access":{},"Nationality":{"noun":"Anguillan(s)","adjective":"Anguillan"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 12 and over can read and write","total population":{"quantity":95,"unit":"%"},"male":{"quantity":95,"unit":"%"},"female":{"quantity":95,"unit":"%"}},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":{"quantity":11,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":11,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":11,"unit":"years"}},"Education expenditures":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"ethnicGroups":["black (predominant) 90.1%","mixed","mulatto 4.6%","white 3.7%","other 1.5% (2001 census)"],"religions":["Anglican 29%","Methodist 23.9%","other Protestant 30.2%","Roman Catholic 5.7%","other Christian 1.7%","other 5.2%","none or unspecified 4.3% (2001 census)"],"languages":["English (official)"]},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"none","conventional short form":"Anguilla"},"Dependency status":"overseas territory of the UK","Government type":"NA","Capital":{"name":"The Valley","geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":18,"min":13},"W":{"deg":63,"min":3}},"time difference":"UTC-4 (1 hour ahead of Washington, DC during Standard Time)"},"Independence":"none (overseas territory of the UK)","National holiday":"Anguilla Day, 30 May (1967)","Legal system":"common law based on the English model","Suffrage":"18 years of age;
