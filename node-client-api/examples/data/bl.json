{"code":"bl","name":"Bolivia","region":"South America","background":"Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR, broke away from Spanish rule in 1825; much of its subsequent history has consisted of a series of nearly 200 coups and countercoups. Democratic civilian rule was established in 1982, but leaders have faced difficult problems of deep-seated poverty, social unrest, and illegal drug production. In December 2005, Bolivians elected Movement Toward Socialism leader Evo MORALES president - by the widest margin of any leader since the restoration of civilian rule in 1982 - after he ran on a promise to change the country's traditional political class and empower the nation's poor, indigenous majority. However, since taking office, his controversial strategies have exacerbated racial and economic tensions between the Amerindian populations of the Andean west and the non-indigenous communities of the eastern lowlands. In December 2009, President MORALES easily won reelection, and his party took control of the legislative branch of the government, which will allow him to continue his process of change.","geo":{"Location":"Central South America, southwest of Brazil","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":17,"min":0},"W":{"deg":65,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":1098,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":1083,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":15280,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than three times the size of Montana","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":6940,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Argentina 832 km, Brazil 3,423 km, Chile 860 km, Paraguay 750 km, Peru 1,075 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"rugged Andes Mountains with a highland plateau (Altiplano), hills, lowland plains of the Amazon Basin","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Rio Paraguay 90 m","highest point":"Nevado Sajama 6,542 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":2.78,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.19,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":97.03,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":1500,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":622.5,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":1.44,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":157,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"flooding in the northeast (March-April)","volcanism":"Bolivia experiences volcanic activity in Andes Mountains on the border with Chile;

Following a disastrous economic crisis during the early 1980s, reforms spurred private investment, stimulated economic growth, and cut poverty rates in the 1990s. The period 2003-05 was characterized by political instability, racial tensions, and violent protests against plans - subsequently abandoned - to export Bolivia's newly discovered natural gas reserves to large northern hemisphere markets. In 2005, the government passed a controversial hydrocarbons law that imposed significantly higher royalties and required foreign firms then operating under risk-sharing contracts to surrender all production to the state energy company in exchange for a predetermined service fee. After higher prices for mining and hydrocarbons exports produced a fiscal surplus in 2008, the global recession in 2009 slowed growth. Nevertheless, Bolivia recorded the highest growth rate in South America that year. During 2010 an increase in world commodity prices resulted in the biggest trade surplus in history. However, a lack of foreign investment in the key sectors of mining and hydrocarbons and higher food prices pose challenges for the Bolivian economy.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":47880000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":19370000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":38,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4186000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":43,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":30.3,"unit":"%"}},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":44.1,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":58.2,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":10110000000},"expenditures":{"usd":10000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":39.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.75,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":5367000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":12160000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":7060000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":3915000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":6085000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":5814000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":43740,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":31070,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":5621,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":17330,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":465000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":14400000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":2410000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":11590000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":750400000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":690200000},"Exports":{"usd":6956000000},"Imports":{"usd":5366000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":9730000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2864000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":7257000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":21000000},"Exchange rates":"bolivianos (BOB) per US dollar -","industries":["mining, smelting, petroleum, food and beverages, tobacco, handicrafts, clothing"],"agricultureProducts":["soybeans","coffee","coca","cotton","corn","sugarcane","rice","potatoes","timber"],"exportCommodities":["natural gas","soybeans and soy products","crude petroleum","zinc ore","tin"],"exportPartners":["Brazil 41.38%","US 13.87%","Japan 5.62%","Colombia 5.32%","South Korea 4.7%","Peru 4.16%"],"importCommodities":["petroleum products","plastics","paper","aircraft and aircraft parts","prepared foods","automobiles","insecticides","soybeans"],"importPartners":["Brazil 27.12%","Argentina 15.69%","US 12.77%","Chile 9.11%","Peru 6.85%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":810200,"Telephones - mobile cellular":7148000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"Bolivian National Telecommunications Company (ENTEL) was privatized in 1995 but re-nationalized in 2007;
