{"code":"mj","name":"Montenegro","region":"Europe","background":"The use of the name Montenegro began in the 15th century when the Crnojevic dynasty began to rule the Serbian principality of Zeta; over subsequent centuries Montenegro was able to maintain its independence from the Ottoman Empire. From the 16th to 19th centuries, Montenegro became a theocracy ruled by a series of bishop princes; in 1852, it was transformed into a secular principality. After World War I, Montenegro was absorbed by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929; at the conclusion of World War II, it became a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. When the latter dissolved in 1992, Montenegro federated with Serbia, first as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and, after 2003, in a looser union of Serbia and Montenegro. In May 2006, Montenegro invoked its right under the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro to hold a referendum on independence from the state union. The vote for severing ties with Serbia exceeded 55% - the threshold set by the EU - allowing Montenegro to formally declare its independence on 3 June 2006.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Europe, between the Adriatic Sea and Serbia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":42,"min":30},"E":{"deg":19,"min":18}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":13812,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":13452,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":360,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Connecticut","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":625,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Albania 172 km, Bosnia and Herzegovina 225 km, Croatia 25 km, Kosovo 79 km, Serbia 124 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":293.5,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"defined by treaty"},"Terrain":"highly indented coastline with narrow coastal plain backed by rugged high limestone mountains and plateaus","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Adriatic Sea 0 m","highest point":"Bobotov Kuk 2,522 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":13.7,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":85.3,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":22,"unit":"sq km"},"Natural hazards":"destructive earthquakes","internationalEnvironmentAgreements":{"signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements","partyTo":["Air Pollution","Biodiversity","Climate Change","Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol","Desertification","Hazardous Wastes","Law of the Sea","Marine Dumping","Marine Life Conservation","Ozone Layer Protection","Ship Pollution"]},"naturalResources":["bauxite","hydroelectricity"],"environmentalIssues":["pollution of coastal waters from sewage outlets, especially in tourist-related areas such as Kotor"],"climate":["Mediterranean climate, hot dry summers and autumns and relatively cold winters with heavy snowfalls inland"],"geographyNote":["strategic location along the Adriatic coast"]},"people":{"Population":661807,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":15.5,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":71,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"13.5% (male 35,551/female 53,696) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":37.8,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":36.5,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":39.2,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":"-0.705% (2011 est.)","Birth rate":{"quantity":11,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":8.89,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":61,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Major cities - population":"PODGORICA (capital) 144,000 (2009)","Sex ratio":{"at birth":{"quantity":1.072,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years":{"quantity":0.95,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":1.08,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over":{"quantity":0.67,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population":{"quantity":0.99,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Drinking water source":{},"Sanitation facility access":{},"Nationality":{"noun":"Montenegrin(s)","adjective":"Montenegrin"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":"NA","Education expenditures":"NA","majorInfectiousDiseases":{"degree of risk":"intermediate","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial diarrhea","vectorborne disease":"Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (2009)"},"ethnicGroups":["Montenegrin 43%","Serbian 32%","Bosniak 8%","Albanian 5%","other (Muslims","Croats","Roma (Gypsy)) 12% (2003 census)"],"religions":["Orthodox 74.2%","Muslim 17.7%","Catholic 3.5%","other 0.6%","unspecified 3%","atheist 1% (2003 census)"],"languages":["Serbian 63.6%","Montenegrin (official) 22%","Bosnian 5.5%","Albanian 5.3%","unspecified 3.7% (2003 census)"]},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"none","conventional short form":"Montenegro","local long form":"none","local short form":"Crna Gora","former":"People's Republic of Montenegro, Socialist Republic of Montenegro, Republic of Montenegro"},"Government type":"republic","Capital":{"name":"Podgorica","geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":42,"min":26},"E":{"deg":19,"min":16}},"time difference":"UTC+1 (6 hours ahead of Washington, DC during Standard Time)","daylight saving time":"+1 hr, begins last Sunday in March;

The dissolution of the loose political union between Serbia and Montenegro in 2006 led to separate membership in several international financial institutions, such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In January 2007, Montenegro joined the World Bank and IMF. Montenegro is pursuing its own membership in the World Trade Organization and signed a Stabilization and Association agreement with the European Union in October 2007. The European Council granted candidate country status to Montenegro at the December 2010 session. Unemployment and regional disparities in development are key political and economic problems. Montenegro has privatized its large aluminum complex - the dominant industry - as well as most of its financial sector, and has begun to attract foreign direct investment in the tourism sector. The global financial crisis has had a significant negative impact on the economy, due to the ongoing credit crunch, a decline in the real estate sector, and a fall in aluminum exports.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":6724000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":4017000000.0000005},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":"NA%"},"Labor force":259100,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":68,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":14.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":30,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":30.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":"$NA","expenditures":"$NA"},"Public debt":{"quantity":38,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.4,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":9.36,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":816800000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1406000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":3290000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":4288999999.9999995},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":2864000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":18600000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":"NA kWh (2005)","Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":5000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":313.6,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":6093,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - consumption":"NA cu m","Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.102 billion (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":171300000},"Imports":{"usd":601700000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA","Debt - external":{"usd":650000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["steelmaking, aluminum, agricultural processing, consumer goods, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["tobacco","potatoes","citrus fruits","olives","grapes","sheep"],"exportPartners":["Italy 29.52%","Greece 22.65%","Slovenia 11.83%","Hungary 8.96%","US 7.93%"],"importPartners":["Italy 17.54%","Slovenia 14.62%","Germany 10.5%","Austria 7.82%","China 7.82%","Russia 4.4%","Hungary 4.11%","Greece 4.11%","Netherlands 4%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":366600,"Telephones - mobile cellular":752000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern telecommunications system with access to European satellites","domestic":"GSM mobile-cellular service, available through multiple providers with national coverage, is growing","international":"country code - 382; 2 international switches connect the national system"},"Broadcast media":"state-owned national radio-TV broadcaster operates 2 terrestrial television networks, 1 satellite TV channel, and 2 radio networks; roughly a dozen privately-owned TV broadcasters operate networks nationally, regionally, and locally; in addition to the 2 state-owned national radio networks, roughly 50 privately-owned radio stations and networks broadcast (2007)","Internet country code":".me","Internet hosts":6247,"Internet users":280000},"transport":{"Airports":5,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":4,"2,438 to 3,047 m":2,"1,524 to 2,437 m":1,"under 914 m":1},"Airports - with unpaved runways":{"total":1,"914 to 1,523 m":1},"Heliports":1,"Railways":{"total":{"quantity":250,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","standard gauge":"250 km 1.435-m gauge (169 km electrified) (2010)"},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":7624,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":5097,"unit":"km"},"unpaved":{"quantity":2527,"unit":"km"}},"Merchant marine":{"total":2,"country comparison to the world":"","by type":"cargo 1, passenger/cargo 1","registered in other countries":"5 (Bahamas 2, Honduras 2, Slovakia 1) (2010)"},"Ports and terminals":"Bar"},"military":{"Military branches":"Armed Forces of the Republic of Montenegro: Army of Montenegro (includes Montenegrin Navy (Mornarica Crne Gore, MCG)), Air Force (2011)","Military service age and obligation":"compulsory national military service abolished August 2006","Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":149159,"females age 16-49":131823},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":3120,"female":3677}},"issues":{"Refugees and internally displaced persons":{"refugees (country of origin)":"7,000 (Kosovo); note - mostly ethnic Serbs and Roma who fled Kosovo in 1999","IDPs":"16,192 (ethnic conflict in 1999 and riots in 2004) (2007)"},"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
