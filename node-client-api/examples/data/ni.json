{"code":"ni","name":"Nigeria","region":"Africa","background":"British influence and control over what would become Nigeria and Africa's most populous country grew through the 19th century. A series of constitutions after World War II granted Nigeria greater autonomy; independence came in 1960. Following nearly 16 years of military rule, a new constitution was adopted in 1999, and a peaceful transition to civilian government was completed. The government continues to face the daunting task of reforming a petroleum-based economy, whose revenues have been squandered through corruption and mismanagement, and institutionalizing democracy. In addition, Nigeria continues to experience longstanding ethnic and religious tensions. Although both the 2003 and 2007 presidential elections were marred by significant irregularities and violence, Nigeria is currently experiencing its longest period of civilian rule since independence. The general elections of April 2007 marked the first civilian-to-civilian transfer of power in the country's history. In January 2010, Nigeria assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2010-11 term.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the Gulf of Guinea, between Benin and Cameroon","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":10,"min":0},"E":{"deg":8,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":923768,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":910768,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":13000,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than twice the size of California","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":4047,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Benin 773 km, Cameroon 1,690 km, Chad 87 km, Niger 1,497 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":853,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"southern lowlands merge into central hills and plateaus;

Nigeria's former military rulers failed to diversify the economy away from its overdependence on the capital-intensive oil sector, which provides 95% of foreign exchange earnings and about 80% of budgetary revenues. Following the signing of an IMF stand-by agreement in August 2000, Nigeria received a debt-restructuring deal from the Paris Club and a $1 billion credit from the IMF, both contingent on economic reforms. Nigeria pulled out of its IMF program in April 2002, after failing to meet spending and exchange rate targets, making it ineligible for additional debt forgiveness from the Paris Club. In November 2005, Abuja won Paris Club approval for a debt-relief deal that eliminated $18 billion of debt in exchange for $12 billion in payments - a total package worth $30 billion of Nigeria's total $37 billion external debt. Since 2008 the government has begun to show the political will to implement the market-oriented reforms urged by the IMF, such as modernizing the banking system, curbing inflation by blocking excessive wage demands, and resolving regional disputes over the distribution of earnings from the oil industry. GDP rose strongly in 2007-10 because of increased oil exports and high global crude prices in 2010. President JONATHAN has pledged to continue the economic reforms of his predecessor with emphasis on infrastructure improvements. Infrastructure is the main impediment to growth and in August 2010 JONATHAN unveiled a power sector blueprint that includes privatization of the state-run electricity generation and distribution facilities. The government also is working toward developing stronger public-private partnerships for roads. Nigeria's financial sector was hurt by the global financial and economic crises and the Central Bank governor has taken measures to strengthen that sector.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":377900000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":216800000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":8.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":31.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":32.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":35.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":48330000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":4.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":32.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":43.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":11.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":18160000000},"expenditures":{"usd":29550000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":13.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":13.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":18.36,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":40410000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":91970000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":77430000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":33320000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":21920000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":19210000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":2211000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":280000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2327000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":170000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":37500000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":32820000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":12280000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":20550000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":5246000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":27770000000},"Exports":{"usd":76330000000},"Imports":{"usd":34180000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":43360000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":11020000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":67230000000.00001},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":6071000000},"Exchange rates":"nairas (NGN) per US dollar -","industries":["crude oil, coal, tin, columbite","rubber products, wood","hides and skins, textiles, cement and other construction materials, food products, footwear, chemicals, fertilizer, printing, ceramics, steel"],"agricultureProducts":["cocoa","peanuts","cotton","palm oil","corn","rice","sorghum","millet","cassava (tapioca)","yams","rubber","cattle","sheep","goats","pigs","timber","fish"],"exportCommodities":["petroleum and petroleum products 95%","cocoa","rubber"],"exportPartners":["US 35.08%","India 10.43%","Brazil 9.32%","Spain 7.19%","France 4.65%"],"importCommodities":["machinery","chemicals","transport equipment","manufactured goods","food and live animals"],"importPartners":["China 14.89%","US 8.88%","Netherlands 8.18%","South Korea 5.46%","UK 4.63%","France 4.19%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1419000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":73099000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"further expansion and modernization of the fixed-line telephone network is needed;
