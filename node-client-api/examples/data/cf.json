A quarter century of experimentation with Marxism was abandoned in 1990 and a democratically elected government took office in 1992. A brief civil war in 1997 restored former Marxist President Denis SASSOU-Nguesso, and ushered in a period of ethnic and political unrest. Southern-based rebel groups agreed to a final peace accord in March 2003, but the calm is tenuous and refugees continue to present a humanitarian crisis. The Republic of Congo was once one of Africa's largest petroleum producers, but with declining production it will need new offshore oil finds to sustain its oil earnings over the long term.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the South Atlantic Ocean, between Angola and Gabon","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":1,"min":0},"E":{"deg":15,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":342000,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":341500,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":500,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing a major share of government revenues and exports. In the early 1980s, rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to finance large-scale development projects with GDP growth averaging 5% annually, one of the highest rates in Africa. Characterized by budget problems and overstaffing, the government has mortgaged a substantial portion of its oil earnings through oil-backed loans that have contributed to a growing debt burden and chronic revenue shortfalls. Economic reform efforts have been undertaken with the support of international organizations, notably the World Bank and the IMF. However, the reform program came to a halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted. Denis SASSOU-Nguesso, who returned to power when the war ended in October 1997, publicly expressed interest in moving forward on economic reforms and privatization and in renewing cooperation with international financial institutions. Economic progress was badly hurt by slumping oil prices and the resumption of armed conflict in December 1998, which worsened the republic's budget deficit. The current administration presides over an uneasy internal peace and faces difficult economic challenges of stimulating recovery and reducing poverty. The drop in oil prices during the global crisis reduced oil revenue by about 30%, but the subsequent recovery of oil prices has boosted the economy's GDP and near-term prospects. In March 2006, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) treatment for Congo, receiving $1.9 billion in debt relief under the program in 2010.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":17110000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":11530000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":9.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":63.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":32,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1514000,"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":37.1,"unit":"%"}},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":41.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":3818000000},"expenditures":{"usd":2599000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":2403000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2746000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1580000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":471000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":449000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":274400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":10000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":241100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2136,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1600000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":180000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":180000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":90610000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-569 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":9200000000},"Imports":{"usd":3607000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":4123000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":5000000000},"Exchange rates":"Cooperation Financiere en Afrique Centrale francs per US dollar -","industries":["petroleum extraction, cement, lumber, brewing, sugar, palm oil, soap, flour, cigarettes"],"agricultureProducts":["cassava (tapioca)","sugar","rice","corn","peanuts","vegetables","coffee","cocoa","forest products"],"exportCommodities":["petroleum","lumber","plywood","sugar","cocoa","coffee","diamonds"],"exportPartners":["US 40.08%","China 30.18%","France 8.17%","Taiwan 6.4%","India 4.2%"],"importCommodities":["capital equipment","construction materials","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["France 20.64%","China 14.54%","Italy 9.56%","US 9.02%","India 5.55%","Belgium 4.51%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":24300,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2171000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"primary network consists of microwave radio relay and coaxial cable with services barely adequate for government use;
