{"code":"so","name":"Somalia","region":"Africa","background":"Britain withdrew from British Somaliland in 1960 to allow its protectorate to join with Italian Somaliland and form the new nation of Somalia. In 1969, a coup headed by Mohamed SIAD Barre ushered in an authoritarian socialist rule characterized by the persecution, jailing and torture of political opponents and dissidents. After the regime's collapse early in 1991, Somalia descended into turmoil, factional fighting, and anarchy. In May 1991, northern clans declared an independent Republic of Somaliland that now includes the administrative regions of Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed, Togdheer, Sanaag, and Sool. Although not recognized by any government, this entity has maintained a stable existence and continues efforts to establish a constitutional democracy, including holding municipal, parliamentary, and presidential elections. The regions of Bari, Nugaal, and northern Mudug comprise a neighboring semi-autonomous state of Puntland, which has been self-governing since 1998 but does not aim at independence; it has also made strides toward reconstructing a legitimate, representative government but has suffered some civil strife. Puntland disputes its border with Somaliland as it also claims portions of eastern Sool and Sanaag. Beginning in 1993, a two-year UN humanitarian effort (primarily in the south) was able to alleviate famine conditions, but when the UN withdrew in 1995, having suffered significant casualties, order still had not been restored. In 2000, the Somalia National Peace Conference (SNPC) held in Djibouti resulted in the formation of an interim government, known as the Transitional National Government (TNG). When the TNG failed to establish adequate security or governing institutions, the Government of Kenya, under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), led a subsequent peace process that concluded in October 2004 with the election of Abdullahi YUSUF Ahmed as President of a second interim government, known as the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of the Somali Republic. The TFG included a 275-member parliamentary body, known as the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP). President YUSUF resigned late in 2008 while United Nations-sponsored talks between the TFG and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS) were underway in Djibouti. In January 2009, following the creation of a TFG-ARS unity government, Ethiopian military forces, which had entered Somalia in December 2006 to support the TFG in the face of advances by the opposition Islamic Courts Union (ICU), withdrew from the country. The TFP was increased to 550 seats with the addition of 200 ARS and 75 civil society members of parliament. The expanded parliament elected Sheikh SHARIF Sheikh Ahmed, the former CIC and ARS chairman as president on 31 January 2009, in Djibouti. Subsequently, President SHARIF appointed Omar Abdirashid ali SHARMARKE, son of a former president of Somalia, as prime minister on 13 February 2009. SHARMARKE resigned in September 2010 and was replaced by Mohamed Abdullahi MOHAMED, aka Farmajo, a dual US-Somali citizen who lived in the United States from 1985 until his return to Somalia in October 2010. The creation of the TFG was based on the Transitional Federal Charter (TFC), which outlines a five-year mandate leading to the establishment of a new Somali constitution and a transition to a representative government following national elections. However, in January 2009 the TFP amended the TFC to extend TFG's mandate until 2011.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Africa, bordering the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, east of Ethiopia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":10,"min":0},"E":{"deg":49,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":637657,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":627337,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":10320,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Texas","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":2340,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Djibouti 58 km, Ethiopia 1,600 km, Kenya 682 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":3025,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"mostly flat to undulating plateau rising to hills in north","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Indian Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Shimbiris 2,416 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":1.64,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.04,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":98.32,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":2000,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":15.7,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":3.29,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":400,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"recurring droughts;

Agriculture is the most important sector with livestock normally accounting for about 40% of GDP and more than 50% of export earnings. Nomads and semi-pastoralists, who are dependent upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion of the population. Livestock, hides, fish, charcoal, and bananas are Somalia's principal exports, while sugar, sorghum, corn, qat, and machined goods are the principal imports. Somalia's small industrial sector, based on the processing of agricultural products, has largely been looted and the machinery sold as scrap metal. Somalia's service sector also has grown. Telecommunication firms provide wireless services in most major cities and offer the lowest international call rates on the continent. In the absence of a formal banking sector, money transfer/remittance services have sprouted throughout the country, handling up to $1.6 billion in remittances annually. Mogadishu's main market offers a variety of goods from food to the newest electronic gadgets. Hotels continue to operate and are supported with private-security militias. Due to armed attacks on and threats to humanitarian aid workers, the World Food Programme partially suspended its operations in southern Somalia in early January 2010 pending improvement in the security situation. Somalia's arrears to the IMF have continued to grow.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":5896000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":2372000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":65,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":"3.447 million (few skilled laborers) (2007)","Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":71,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":29,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":"$NA","expenditures":"$NA"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"NA%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":280000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":260399999.99999997,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":108.1,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":5000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1475,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":6387,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":5663000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":300000000},"Imports":{"usd":798000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":3000000000},"Exchange rates":"Somali shillings (SOS) per US dollar -","industries":["a few light industries, including sugar refining, textiles, wireless communication"],"agricultureProducts":["bananas","sorghum","corn","coconuts","rice","sugarcane","mangoes","sesame seeds","beans","cattle","sheep","goats","fish"],"exportCommodities":["livestock","bananas","hides","fish","charcoal","scrap metal"],"exportPartners":["UAE 58.27%","Yemen 20.32%","Saudi Arabia 3.78%"],"importCommodities":["manufactures","petroleum products","foodstuffs","construction materials","qat"],"importPartners":["Djibouti 30.84%","Kenya 8.06%","India 7.86%","China 6.97%","Brazil 6.59%","Yemen 4.97%","Oman 4.72%","UAE 4.6%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":100000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":641000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"the public telecommunications system was almost completely destroyed or dismantled during the civil war;
