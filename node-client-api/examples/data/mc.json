After opening up its locally-controlled casino industry to foreign competition in 2001, the territory attracted tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment, transforming Macau into one of the world's largest gaming center. Macau's gaming and tourism businesses were fueled by China's decision to relax travel restrictions on Chinese citizens wishing to visit Macau. By 2006, Macau's gaming revenue surpassed that of the Las Vegas strip, and gaming-related taxes accounted for more than 70% of total government revenue. In 2008, Macau introduced measures to cool the rapidly developing sector. This city of nearly 552,300 hosted nearly 25 million visitors in 2010. Almost 53% came from mainland China. Macau's traditional manufacturing industry has virtually disappeared since the termination of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. In 2010, total exports were less than US$900 million, while gaming receipts were almost US$24 billion, a 58% increase over 2009. The Macau government plans to tighten control over the opening of new casinos and strengthen supervision of local casino operations in 2011 and has introduced measures to diversify the economy. The Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between Macau and mainland China that came into effect on 1 January 2004 offers Macau-made products tariff-free access to the mainland; nevertheless, China is Macau's second largest goods export market, behind Hong Kong, and followed by the United States. Macau's currency, the pataca, is closely tied to the Hong Kong dollar, which is also freely accepted in the territory.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":18470000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":22100000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":97.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":330900,"Labor force - by occupation":{"manufacturing":{"quantity":4.3,"unit":"%"},"construction":{"quantity":8.7,"unit":"%"},"transport and communications":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"wholesale and retail trade":{"quantity":13.3,"unit":"%"},"restaurants and hotels":{"quantity":12.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":9950000000},"expenditures":{"usd":7180000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.25,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4340000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":30410000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":16329999999.999998},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":46100000000},"Industrial production growth rate":"-23.7%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":1100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":3660000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":2790000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":6490,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":6284,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":154700000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":154500000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":174000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":6230000000},"Exports":{"Exports":{"usd":870000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Imports":{"usd":5500000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":23730000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":null},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":12100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":240000000},"Exchange rates":"patacas (MOP) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, gambling, clothing, textiles, electronics, footwear, toys"],"agricultureProducts":["only 2% of land area is cultivated","mainly by vegetable growers","fishing","mostly for crustaceans","is important","some of the catch is exported to Hong Kong"],"exportCommodities":["clothing","textiles","footwear","toys","electronics","machinery and parts"],"exportPartners":["Hong Kong 38.7%","US 17.9%","China 14.4%","Germany 4% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["raw materials and semi-manufactured goods","consumer goods (foodstuffs","beverages","tobacco)","capital goods","mineral fuels and oils"],"importPartners":["China 31.1%","Hong Kong 10.8%","Japan 8.1%","France 8%","US 6.2% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":168903,"Telephones - mobile cellular":1109000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"fairly modern communication facilities maintained for domestic and international services","domestic":"termination of monopoly over mobile-cellular telephone services in 2001 spurred sharp increase in subscriptions with mobile-cellular teledensity approaching 200 per 100 persons in 2010;
