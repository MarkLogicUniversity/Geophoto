{"code":"mk","name":"Macedonia","region":"Europe","background":"Macedonia gained its independence peacefully from Yugoslavia in 1991. Greece's objection to the new state's use of what it considered a Hellenic name and symbols delayed international recognition, which occurred under the provisional designation of \"the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\" In 1995, Greece lifted a 20-month trade embargo and the two countries agreed to normalize relations. The United States began referring to Macedonia by its constitutional name, Republic of Macedonia, in 2004 and negotiations continue between Greece and Macedonia to resolve the name issue. Some ethnic Albanians, angered by perceived political and economic inequities, launched an insurgency in 2001 that eventually won the support of the majority of Macedonia's Albanian population and led to the internationally-brokered Ohrid Framework Agreement, which ended the fighting by establishing a set of new laws enhancing the rights of minorities. Fully implementing the Framework Agreement and stimulating economic growth and development continue to be challenges for Macedonia, although progress has been made on both fronts over the past several years.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Europe, north of Greece","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":41,"min":50},"E":{"deg":22,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":25713,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":25433,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":280,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Vermont","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":766,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Albania 151 km, Bulgaria 148 km, Greece 246 km, Kosovo 159 km, Serbia 62 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"mountainous territory covered with deep basins and valleys;

At independence in September 1991, Macedonia was the least developed of the Yugoslav republics, producing a mere 5% of the total federal output of goods and services. The collapse of Yugoslavia ended transfer payments from the central government and eliminated advantages from inclusion in a de facto free trade area. An absence of infrastructure, UN sanctions on the downsized Yugoslavia, and a Greek economic embargo over a dispute about the country's constitutional name and flag hindered economic growth until 1996. Since then, Macedonia has maintained macroeconomic stability with low inflation, but it has so far lagged the region in attracting foreign investment and creating jobs, despite making extensive fiscal and business sector reforms. Official unemployment remains high at 31.7%, but may be overstated based on the existence of an extensive gray market, estimated to be more than 20% of GDP, that is not captured by official statistics. In the wake of the global economic downturn, Macedonia has experienced decreased foreign direct investment, lowered credit, and a large trade deficit. However, as a result of conservative fiscal policies and a sound financial system, in 2010 the country received slightly improved credit ratings. Macroeconomic stability also was maintained by a prudent monetary policy, which kept the domestic currency at the pegged level against the euro, while interest rates were falling. As a result, GDP growth was modest, but positive, in 2010.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":20000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":9108000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":8.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":22.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":69.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":949300,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":19.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":22.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":58,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":31.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":28.7,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":29.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":39,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":23.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":2772000000},"expenditures":{"usd":3011000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":34.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8.2,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1146000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4134000000.0000005},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":4001000000.0000005},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":2647000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":6819000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":8189000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":1370000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":18200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":8594,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":18200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":117400000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":117400000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-328 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":3171000000},"Imports":{"usd":5113000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2217000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":5485000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":3739000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Exchange rates":"Macedonian denars (MKD) per US dollar -","industries":["food processing, beverages, textiles, chemicals, iron, steel, cement, energy, pharmaceuticals"],"agricultureProducts":["grapes","tobacco","vegetables","fruits","milk","eggs"],"exportCommodities":["food","beverages","tobacco","textiles","miscellaneous manufactures","iron and steel"],"exportPartners":["Germany 20.31%","Greece 13.09%","Italy 11.08%","Bulgaria 10.61%","Croatia 7.74%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","automobiles","chemicals","fuels","food products"],"importPartners":["Germany 15.11%","Greece 14.88%","Bulgaria 9.08%","Italy 7.68%","Turkey 7.59%","Slovenia 6.26%","Hungary 4.31%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":442200,"Telephones - mobile cellular":1943000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"competition from the mobile-cellular segment of the telecommunications market has led to a drop in fixed-line telephone subscriptions","domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular telephone subscribership about 115 per 100 persons","international":"country code - 389 (2009)"},"Broadcast media":"public television broadcaster operates 3 national channels and a satellite network;
