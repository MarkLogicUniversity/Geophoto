The military, which took over full responsibility for security following the departure of UN peacekeepers at the end of 2005, is increasingly developing as a guarantor of the country's stability. The armed forces remained on the sideline during the 2007 presidential election, but still look to the UN Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) - a civilian UN mission - to support efforts to consolidate peace. The new government's priorities include furthering development, creating jobs, and stamping out endemic corruption.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Guinea and Liberia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":8,"min":30},"W":{"deg":11,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":71740,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":71620,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":120,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

While it possesses substantial mineral, agricultural, and fishery resources, its physical and social infrastructure has yet to recover from the civil war, and serious social disorders continue to hamper economic development. Nearly half of the working-age population engages in subsistence agriculture. Manufacturing consists mainly of the processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Alluvial diamond mining remains the major source of hard currency earnings, accounting for nearly half of Sierra Leone's exports. The fate of the economy depends upon the maintenance of domestic peace and the continued receipt of substantial aid from abroad, which is essential to offset the severe trade imbalance and supplement government revenues. The IMF has completed a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility program that helped stabilize economic growth and reduce inflation and in 2010 approved a new program worth $45 million over three years. Political stability has led to a revival of economic activity such as the rehabilitation of bauxite and rutile mining, which are set to benefit from planned tax incentives. A number of offshore oil discoveries were announced in 2009 and 2010. The development on these reserves, which could be significant, is still several years away.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":4720000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1905000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":49,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":31,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":21,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2207000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":"NA%"},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":70.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":33.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":62.9,"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":96000000},"expenditures":{"usd":351000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":11.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA% (31 December 2010)","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":209400000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":437000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":178400000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":80000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":74400000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":28.98,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":9000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":502.4,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":8316,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-63 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":216000000},"Imports":{"usd":560000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1610000000},"Exchange rates":"leones (SLL) per US dollar -","industries":["diamond mining","small-scale manufacturing (beverages, textiles, cigarettes, footwear)","petroleum refining, small commercial ship repair"],"agricultureProducts":["rice","coffee","cocoa","palm kernels","palm oil","peanuts","poultry","cattle","sheep","pigs","fish"],"exportCommodities":["diamonds","rutile","cocoa","coffee","fish"],"exportPartners":["Belgium 26.56%","US 11.87%","Netherlands 7.91%","UK 7.4%","India 6.67%","Cote d'Ivoire 6.13%","Greece 4.05%"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","machinery and equipment","fuels and lubricants","chemicals"],"importPartners":["South Africa 14.61%","China 7.58%","US 5.87%","Cote d'Ivoire 5.65%","India 5.19%","Malaysia 5.19%","France 5.08%","UK 4.48%","Netherlands 4.06%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":32800,"Telephones - mobile cellular":1160000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"marginal telephone service with poor infrastructure","domestic":"the national microwave radio relay trunk system connects Freetown to Bo and Kenema;
