{"code":"za","name":"Zambia","region":"Africa","background":"The territory of Northern Rhodesia was administered by the [British] South Africa Company from 1891 until it was taken over by the UK in 1923. During the 1920s and 1930s, advances in mining spurred development and immigration. The name was changed to Zambia upon independence in 1964. In the 1980s and 1990s, declining copper prices, economic mismanagement and a prolonged drought hurt the economy. Elections in 1991 brought an end to one-party rule, but the subsequent vote in 1996 saw blatant harassment of opposition parties. The election in 2001 was marked by administrative problems with three parties filing a legal petition challenging the election of ruling party candidate Levy MWANAWASA. The new president launched an anticorruption investigation in 2002 to probe high-level corruption during the previous administration. In 2006-07, this task force successfully prosecuted four cases, including a landmark civil case in the UK in which former President CHILUBA and numerous others were found liable for more than USD 41 million. MWANAWASA was reelected in 2006 in an election that was deemed free and fair. Upon his abrupt death in August 2008, he was succeeded by his Vice President Rupiah BANDA, who subsequently won a special presidential by-election in October 2008. Under President BANDA, the Task Force on Corruption was abolished, President CHILUBA and his wife were acquitted in their criminal cases, and the government declined to register the UK civil verdict.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Africa, east of Angola, south of the Democratic Republic of the Congo","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":15,"min":0},"E":{"deg":30,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":752618,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":743398,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":9220,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Texas","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":5664,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Angola 1,110 km, Democratic Republic of the Congo 1,930 km, Malawi 837 km, Mozambique 419 km, Namibia 233 km, Tanzania 338 km, Zimbabwe 797 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"mostly high plateau with some hills and mountains","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Zambezi river 329 m","highest point":"unnamed elevation in Mafinga Hills 2,301 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":6.99,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.04,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":92.97,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":1560,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":105.2,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":1.74,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":149,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"periodic drought;

Privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly increased copper mining output and profitability to spur economic growth. Copper output has increased steadily since 2004, due to higher copper prices and foreign investment. In 2005, Zambia qualified for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative, consisting of approximately USD 6 billion in debt relief. Poverty remains a significant problem in Zambia, despite a stronger economy. Zambia's dependency on copper makes it vulnerable to depressed commodity prices, but record high copper prices and a bumper maize crop in 2010 helped Zambia rebound quickly from the world economic slowdown that began in 2008. A high birth rate, relatively high HIV/AIDS burden, and market distorting agricultural policies have meant that Zambia's economic growth has not dramatically decreased the stubbornly high poverty rates.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":20040000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":16190000000.000002},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":19.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":33.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":46.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5524000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":85,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":64,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":38.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":50.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":3200000000},"expenditures":{"usd":3743000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":24.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":8.39,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":22.06,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1234000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":3573000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2992000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":12.1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":9752000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":8838000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":268000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":222000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":159.5,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":16000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":275.3,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":14730,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-99 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":6463000000},"Imports":{"usd":4949000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2287000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":3495000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Zambian kwacha (ZMK) per US dollar -","industries":["copper mining and processing, construction, foodstuffs, beverages, chemicals, textiles, fertilizer, horticulture"],"agricultureProducts":["corn","sorghum","rice","peanuts","sunflower seed","vegetables","flowers","tobacco","cotton","sugarcane","cassava (tapioca)","coffee","cattle","goats","pigs","poultry","milk","eggs","hides"],"exportCommodities":["copper/cobalt 64%","cobalt","electricity","tobacco","flowers","cotton"],"exportPartners":["China 21.37%","Saudi Arabia 8.93%","Democratic Republic of the Congo 8.55%","South Korea 8.32%","Egypt 8.08%","South Africa 6.96%","India 5%"],"importCommodities":["machinery","transportation equipment","petroleum products","electricity","fertilizer","foodstuffs","clothing"],"importPartners":["South Africa 51.78%","UAE 7.7%","China 5.85%","Democratic Republic of the Congo 4.22%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":90300,"Telephones - mobile cellular":4407000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"among the best in Sub-Saharan Africa","domestic":"high-capacity microwave radio relay connects most larger towns and cities;
