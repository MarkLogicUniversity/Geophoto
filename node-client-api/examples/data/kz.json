{"code":"kz","name":"Kazakhstan","region":"Central Asia","background":"Ethnic Kazakhs, a mix of Turkic and Mongol nomadic tribes who migrated into the region in the 13th century, were rarely united as a single nation. The area was conquered by Russia in the 18th century, and Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic in 1936. During the 1950s and 1960s agricultural \"Virgin Lands\" program, Soviet citizens were encouraged to help cultivate Kazakhstan's northern pastures. This influx of immigrants (mostly Russians, but also some other deported nationalities) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled non-ethnic Kazakhs to outnumber natives. Independence in 1991 drove many of these newcomers to emigrate. Kazakhstan's economy is larger than those of all the other Central Asian states largely due to the country's vast natural resources. Current issues include: developing a cohesive national identity; expanding the development of the country's vast energy resources and exporting them to world markets; diversifying the economy outside the oil, gas, and mining sectors; enhancing Kazakhstan's economic competitiveness; developing a multiparty parliament and advancing political and social reform; and strengthening relations with neighboring states and other foreign powers.","geo":{"Location":"Central Asia, northwest of China;

It also has a large agricultural sector featuring livestock and grain. In 2002 Kazakhstan became the first country in the former Soviet Union to receive an investment-grade credit rating, and from 2000 through 2007, Kazakhstan's economy grew more than 9% per year. Extractive industries, particularly hydrocarbons and mining, have been the engines of this growth. However, geographic limitations and decaying infrastructure present serious obstacles. Landlocked, with restricted access to the high seas, Kazakhstan relies on its neighbors to export its products, especially oil and gas. Although its Caspian Sea ports and rail lines carrying oil have been upgraded, civil aviation has been neglected. Telecoms are improving, but require considerable investment, as does the information technology base. Supply and distribution of electricity can be erratic. At the end of 2007, global financial markets froze up and the loss of capital inflows to Kazakhstani banks caused a credit crunch. The subsequent and sharp fall of oil and commodity prices in 2008 aggravated the economic situation, and Kazakhstan plunged into recession. While the global financial crisis took a significant toll on Kazakhstan's economy, it has rebounded well. In response to the crisis, Kazakhstan's government devalued the tenge (Kazakhstan's currency) to stabilize market pressures and injected $19 billion in economic stimulus. Rising commodity prices have helped revive Kazakhstan's economy, which registered 7% growth in 2010. Barring a dramatic decline in oil prices, strong growth is expected to continue in 2011. Despite solid macroeconomic indicators, the government realizes that its economy suffers from an overreliance on oil and extractive industries, the so-called \"Dutch disease.\" In response, Kazakhstan has embarked on an ambitious diversification program, aimed at developing targeted sectors like transport, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, petrochemicals and food processing.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":196400000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":138400000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":42.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":51.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":8718000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":28.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":18.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":53.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":8.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":26.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":24.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":27500000000},"expenditures":{"usd":31600000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":16.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":15000000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":58000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":44530000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":57660000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7.3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":78400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":77900000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":3617000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":1940000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":1540000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":241000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1345000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":164000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":30000000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":35610000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":33680000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":17660000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":3720000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":2407000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":6993000000},"Exports":{"usd":59230000000},"Imports":{"usd":30110000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":32439999999.999996},"Debt - external":{"usd":94440000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":83300000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":7208000000},"Exchange rates":"tenge (KZT) per US dollar -","industries":["oil, coal, iron ore, manganese, chromite, lead, zinc, copper, titanium, bauxite, gold, silver, phosphates, sulfur, uranium, iron and steel","tractors and other agricultural machinery, electric motors, construction materials"],"agricultureProducts":["grain (mostly spring wheat)","cotton","livestock"],"exportCommodities":["oil and oil products 59%","ferrous metals 19%","chemicals 5%","machinery 3%","grain","wool","meat","coal"],"exportPartners":["China 16.34%","France 9.23%","Germany 8.32%","Russia 6.9%","Ukraine 5.52%","Romania 5.25%","Italy 5.12%","US 4.34%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","metal products","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["Russia 28.5%","China 26.72%","Germany 6.59%","Italy 5.58%","Ukraine 4.8%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":3763000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":14995000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"inherited an outdated telecommunications network from the Soviet era requiring modernization","domestic":"intercity by landline and microwave radio relay;
