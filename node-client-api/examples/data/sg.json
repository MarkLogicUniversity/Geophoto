{"code":"sg","name":"Senegal","region":"Africa","background":"The French colonies of Senegal and the French Sudan were merged in 1959 and granted their independence as the Mali Federation in 1960. The union broke up after only a few months. Senegal joined with The Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in 1982. The envisaged integration of the two countries was never carried out, and the union was dissolved in 1989. The Movement of Democratic Forces in the Casamance (MFDC) has led a low-level separatist insurgency in southern Senegal since the 1980s, and several peace deals have failed to resolve the conflict. Nevertheless, Senegal remains one of the most stable democracies in Africa. Senegal was ruled by a Socialist Party for 40 years until current President Abdoulaye WADE was elected in 2000. He was reelected in February 2007 and has amended Senegal's constitution over a dozen times to increase executive power and to weaken the opposition, part of the president's increasingly autocratic governing style. Senegal has a long history of participating in international peacekeeping and regional mediation.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":14,"min":0},"W":{"deg":14,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":196722,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":192530,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":4192,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than South Dakota","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":2640,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"The Gambia 740 km, Guinea 330 km, Guinea-Bissau 338 km, Mali 419 km, Mauritania 813 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":531,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"generally low, rolling, plains rising to foothills in southeast","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"unnamed elevation southwest of Kedougou 581 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":12.51,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.24,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":87.25,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":1200,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":39.4,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":2.22,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":190,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"lowlands seasonally flooded;

The country's key export industries are phosphate mining, fertilizer production, and commercial fishing. The country is also working on iron ore and oil exploration projects. In January 1994, Senegal undertook a bold and ambitious economic reform program with the support of the international donor community. Government price controls and subsidies have been steadily dismantled. After seeing its economy contract by 2.1% in 1993, Senegal made an important turnaround, thanks to the reform program, with real growth in GDP averaging over 5% annually during 1995-2007. Annual inflation had been pushed down to the single digits. The country was adversely affected by the global economic downturn in 2009 and GDP growth fell below 2%. As a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Senegal is working toward greater regional integration with a unified external tariff and a more stable monetary policy. High unemployment, however, continues to prompt illegal migrants to flee Senegal in search of better job opportunities in Europe. Under the IMF's Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief program, Senegal benefited from eradication of two-thirds of its bilateral, multilateral, and private-sector debt. In 2007, Senegal and the IMF agreed to a new, non-disbursing, Policy Support Initiative program which was completed in 2010. Senegal received its first disbursement from the $540 million Millennium Challenge Account compact it signed in September 2009 for infrastructure and agriculture development. In 2010, the Senegalese people protested against frequent power cuts. The government pledged to expand capacity by 2012 and to promote renewable energy but until Senegal has more capacity, more protests are likely and economic activity will be hindered. During the year, bakers protested government price controls on bread. Foreign investment in Senegal is constrained by Senegal's business environment, which has slipped in recent years, and by perceptions of corruption.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":23880000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":12880000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":14.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":21.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":63.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5530000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":77.5,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":22.5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":48,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":54,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":30.1,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":41.3,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":25.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":2726000000},"expenditures":{"usd":3315000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":32.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":2800000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4603000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":3516000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1880000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":1384000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":39000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":5653,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":42850,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":50000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":50000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":"NA cu m","Current account balance":"$-1.046 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":2112000000},"Imports":{"usd":4474000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2200000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":3885000000},"Exchange rates":"Communaute Financiere Africaine francs (XOF) per US dollar -","industries":["agricultural and fish processing, phosphate mining, fertilizer production, petroleum refining","iron ore, zircon, and gold mining, construction materials, ship construction and repair"],"agricultureProducts":["peanuts","millet","corn","sorghum","rice","cotton","tomatoes","green vegetables","cattle","poultry","pigs","fish"],"exportCommodities":["fish","groundnuts (peanuts)","petroleum products","phosphates","cotton"],"exportPartners":["Mali 20.12%","India 9.84%","The Gambia 5.58%","France 5.02%","Italy 4.23%"],"importCommodities":["food and beverages","capital goods","fuels"],"importPartners":["France 19.58%","UK 9.64%","China 8.08%","Netherlands 5.64%","Thailand 4.75%","US 3.97%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":278800,"Telephones - mobile cellular":6902000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"good system with microwave radio relay, coaxial cable and fiber-optic cable in trunk system","domestic":"above-average urban system with a fiber-optic network;
