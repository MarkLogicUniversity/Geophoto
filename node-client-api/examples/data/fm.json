The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for high-grade phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry exists, but the remote location, a lack of adequate facilities, and limited air connections hinder development. Under the original terms of the Compact of Free Association, the US provided $1.3 billion in grant aid during the period 1986-2001; the level of aid has been subsequently reduced. The Amended Compact of Free Association with the US guarantees the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) millions of dollars in annual aid through 2023, and establishes a Trust Fund into which the US and the FSM make annual contributions in order to provide annual payouts to the FSM in perpetuity after 2023. The country's medium-term economic outlook appears fragile due not only to the reduction in US assistance but also to the current slow growth of the private sector.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":238100000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":238100000},"GDP - real growth rate":"NA%","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":28.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":15.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":55.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":16360,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":34.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":64.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":26.7,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":166000000},"expenditures":{"usd":152700000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":15.38,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":29020000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":114000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":65680000.00000001},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":192000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":178600000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Current account balance":"$-34.3 million (FY05 est.)","Exports":{"usd":14000000},"Imports":{"usd":132699999.99999999},"Debt - external":{"usd":60800000},"Exchange rates":"the US dollar is used","industries":["tourism, construction","fish processing, specialized aquaculture","craft items (from shell, wood, and pearls)"],"agricultureProducts":["black pepper","tropical fruits and vegetables","coconuts","bananas","cassava (tapioca)","sakau (kava)","Kosraen citrus","betel nuts","sweet potatoes","pigs","chickens","fish"],"exportCommodities":["fish","garments","bananas","black pepper","sakau (kava)","betel nut"],"importCommodities":["food","manufactured goods","machinery and equipment","beverages"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":8700,"Telephones - mobile cellular":38000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"adequate system","domestic":"islands interconnected by shortwave radiotelephone (used mostly for government purposes), satellite (Intelsat) ground stations, and some coaxial and fiber-optic cable; mobile-cellular service available on Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap","international":"country code - 691; satellite earth stations - 5 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean) (2002)"},"Broadcast media":"no television broadcast stations; each state has a multi-channel cable service with television transmissions carrying roughly 95% imported programming and 5% local programming; about a half dozen radio stations in operation (2009)","Internet country code":".fm","Internet hosts":3097,"Internet users":17000},"transport":{"Airports":6,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":6,"1,524 to 2,437 m":4,"914 to 1,523 m":2},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":240,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":42,"unit":"km"},"unpaved":{"quantity":198,"unit":"km"}},"Merchant marine":{"total":3,"country comparison to the world":"","by type":"cargo 1, passenger/cargo 2 (2010)"},"Ports and terminals":"Colonia (Tomil Harbor), Lele Harbor, Pohnepi Harbor"},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":26712},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":22008,"females age 16-49":23501},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":1276,"female":1253},"Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of the US"},"issues":{"Illicit drugs":"major consumer of cannabis","internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
