It enjoys a remarkably open and corruption-free environment, stable prices, and a per capita GDP higher than that of most developed countries. The economy depends heavily on exports, particularly in consumer electronics, information technology products, pharmaceuticals, and on a growing financial services sector. Real GDP growth averaged 7.1% between 2004 and 2007. The economy contracted 1.3% in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis, but rebounded nearly 14.7% in 2010, on the strength of renewed exports. Over the longer term, the government hopes to establish a new growth path that focuses on raising productivity, which has sunk to 1% growth per year in the last decade. Singapore has attracted major investments in pharmaceuticals and medical technology production and will continue efforts to establish Singapore as Southeast Asia's financial and high-tech hub.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":291900000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":222700000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":14.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":27.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":72.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3075000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":30.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":69.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":4.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":23.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":47.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":27.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":29870000000},"expenditures":{"usd":34009999999.999996}},"Public debt":{"Public debt":{"quantity":102.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.38,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":82130000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":294400000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":199800000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":620500000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":39210000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":37110000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":10910,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":927000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1374000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1195000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":8340999999.999999,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":8340999999.999999,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":44080000000},"Exports":{"usd":351200000000},"Imports":{"usd":310400000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":225800000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":21660000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":274600000000.00003},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":172100000000},"Exchange rates":"Singapore dollars (SGD) per US dollar -","industries":["electronics, chemicals, financial services, oil drilling equipment, petroleum refining, rubber processing and rubber products, processed food and beverages, ship repair, offshore platform construction, life sciences, entrepot trade"],"agricultureProducts":["orchids","vegetables","poultry","eggs","fish","ornamental fish"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and equipment (including electronics)","consumer goods","pharmaceuticals and other chemicals","mineral fuels"],"exportPartners":["Hong Kong 11.6%","Malaysia 11.5%","US 11.2%","Indonesia 9.7%","China 9.7%","Japan 4.6%","Hong Kong 11.6% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","mineral fuels","chemicals","foodstuffs","consumer goods"],"importPartners":["US 14.7%","Malaysia 11.6%","China 10.5%","Japan 7.6%","Indonesia 5.8%","South Korea 5.7% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1852000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":6652000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"excellent service","domestic":"excellent domestic facilities;
