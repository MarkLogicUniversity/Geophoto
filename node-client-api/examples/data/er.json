{"code":"er","name":"Eritrea","region":"Africa","background":"The UN awarded Eritrea to Ethiopia in 1952 as part of a federation. Ethiopia's annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years later sparked a 30-year struggle for independence that ended in 1991 with Eritrean rebels defeating governmental forces; independence was overwhelmingly approved in a 1993 referendum. A two-and-a-half-year border war with Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 ended under UN auspices in December 2000. Eritrea hosted a UN peacekeeping operation that monitored a 25 km-wide Temporary Security Zone (TSZ) on the border with Ethiopia. Eritrea's denial of fuel to the mission caused the UN to withdraw the mission and terminate its mandate 31 July 2008. An international commission, organized to resolve the border dispute, posted its findings in 2002. However, both parties have been unable to reach agreement on implementing the decision. On 30 November 2007, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission remotely demarcated the border by coordinates and dissolved itself, leaving Ethiopia still occupying several tracts of disputed territory, including the town of Badme. Eritrea accepted the EEBC's \"virtual demarcation\" decision and called on Ethiopia to remove its troops from the TSZ that it states is Eritrean territory. Ethiopia has not accepted the virtual demarcation decision. In 2009 the UN imposed sanctions on Eritrea after accusing it of backing anti-Ethiopian Islamist insurgents in Somalia.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Africa, bordering the Red Sea, between Djibouti and Sudan","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":15,"min":0},"E":{"deg":39,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":117600,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":101000,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":16600,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Pennsylvania","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1626,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Djibouti 109 km, Ethiopia 912 km, Sudan 605 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2234,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"dominated by extension of Ethiopian north-south trending highlands, descending on the east to a coastal desert plain, on the northwest to hilly terrain and on the southwest to flat-to-rolling plains","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"near Kulul within the Danakil Depression -75 m","highest point":"Soira 3,018 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":4.78,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.03,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":95.19,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":210,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":6.3,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":0.3,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":68,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"frequent droughts;

Eritrea has a command economy under the control of the sole political party, the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ). Like the economies of many African nations, a large share of the population - nearly 80% - is engaged in subsistence agriculture, but they produce only a small share of total output. Since the conclusion of the Ethiopian-Eritrea war in 2000, the government has maintained a firm grip on the economy, expanding the use of the military and party-owned businesses to complete Eritrea's development agenda. The government strictly controls the use of foreign currency by limiting access and availability. Few private enterprises remain in Eritrea. Eritrea's economy depends heavily on taxes paid by members of the diaspora. Erratic rainfall and the delayed demobilization of agriculturalists from the military continue to interfere with agricultural production, and Eritrea's recent harvests have been unable to meet the food needs of the country. The Government continues to place its hope for additional revenue on the development of several international mining projects. Despite difficulties for international companies in working with the Eritrean Government, a Canadian mining company signed a contract with the government in 2007 and began mineral extraction in 2010. Eritrea's economic future depends upon its ability to master social problems such as illiteracy, unemployment, and low skills, and more importantly, on the government's willingness to support a true market economy.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":3625000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":2117000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":11.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":67.7,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1935000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":10.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":463400000},"expenditures":{"usd":920100000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1382000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2872000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2919000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":271000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":228000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":5000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4790,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-212 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":25000000},"Imports":{"usd":738000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":104000000},"Debt - external":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Exchange rates":"nakfa (ERN) per US dollar -","industries":["food processing, beverages, clothing and textiles, light manufacturing, salt, cement"],"agricultureProducts":["sorghum","lentils","vegetables","corn","cotton","tobacco","sisal","livestock","goats","fish"],"exportCommodities":["livestock","sorghum","textiles","food","small manufactures"],"exportPartners":["India 25.3%","Italy 20.7%","Sudan 14.1%","China 12.9%","France 5.5%","Saudi Arabia 5.4%"],"importCommodities":["machinery","petroleum products","food","manufactured goods"],"importPartners":["Saudi Arabia 20.7%","India 13.6%","Italy 12.6%","China 9.9%","US 5.1%","Germany 4.6%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":48500,"Telephones - mobile cellular":141100,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"inadequate;
