{"code":"my","name":"Malaysia","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"During the late 18th and 19th centuries, Great Britain established colonies and protectorates in the area of current Malaysia; these were occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945. In 1948, the British-ruled territories on the Malay Peninsula formed the Federation of Malaya, which became independent in 1957. Malaysia was formed in 1963 when the former British colonies of Singapore and the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak on the northern coast of Borneo joined the Federation. The first several years of the country's history were marred by a Communist insurgency, Indonesian confrontation with Malaysia, Philippine claims to Sabah, and Singapore's secession from the Federation in 1965. During the 22-year term of Prime Minister MAHATHIR bin Mohamad (1981-2003), Malaysia was successful in diversifying its economy from dependence on exports of raw materials to expansion in manufacturing, services, and tourism. Current Prime Minister Mohamed NAJIB bin Abdul Razak (in office since April 2009) has continued these pro-business policies.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Asia, peninsula bordering Thailand and northern one-third of the island of Borneo, bordering Indonesia, Brunei, and the South China Sea, south of Vietnam","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":2,"min":30},"E":{"deg":112,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":329847,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":328657,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":1190,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than New Mexico","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":2669,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Brunei 381 km, Indonesia 1,782 km, Thailand 506 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":4675,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation;

Under current Prime Minister NAJIB, Malaysia is attempting to achieve high-income status by 2020 and to move farther up the value-added production chain by attracting investments in Islamic finance, high technology industries, biotechnology, and services. The NAJIB administration also is continuing efforts to boost domestic demand and reduce the economy's dependence on exports. Nevertheless, exports - particularly of electronics, oil and gas, palm oil and rubber - remain a significant driver of the economy. As an oil and gas exporter, Malaysia has profited from higher world energy prices, although the rising cost of domestic gasoline and diesel fuel, combined with strained government finances, has forced Kuala Lumpur begin to reduce government subsidies. The government is also trying to lessen its dependence on state oil producer Petronas, which supplies more than 40% of government revenue. The central bank maintains healthy foreign exchange reserves and its well-developed regulatory regime has limited Malaysia's exposure to riskier financial instruments and the global financial crisis. Nevertheless, decreasing worldwide demand for consumer goods hurt Malaysia's exports and economic growth in 2009, although both showed signs of recovery in 2010. In order to attract increased investment, NAJIB has raised possible revisions to the special economic and social preferences accorded to ethnic Malays under the New Economic Policy of 1970, but he has encountered significant opposition, especially from Malay nationalists and other vested interests.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":414400000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":238000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":9.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":41.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":49.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":12200000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":36,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":51,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":28.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":44.1,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":46780000000},"expenditures":{"usd":46340000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":53.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":2.83,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":6.27,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":73800000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":358100000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":314700000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":256000000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":107400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":93800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":91700000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":693700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":536000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":511900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":314600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":2900000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":57300000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":26270000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":31030000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":2350000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":34140000000},"Exports":{"usd":210300000000},"Imports":{"usd":174300000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":106500000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":72600000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":77440000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":82650000000},"Exchange rates":"ringgits (MYR) per US dollar -","industries":["Peninsular Malaysia - rubber and oil palm processing and manufacturing, light manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, medical technology, electronics, tin mining and smelting, logging, timber processing","Sabah - logging, petroleum production","Sarawak - agriculture processing, petroleum production and refining, logging"],"agricultureProducts":["Peninsular Malaysia - rubber","palm oil","cocoa","rice","Sabah - subsistence crops","coconuts","rice","rubber","timber","Sarawak - rubber","timber","pepper"],"exportCommodities":["electronic equipment","petroleum and liquefied natural gas","wood and wood products","palm oil","rubber","textiles","chemicals"],"exportPartners":["Singapore 13.4%","China 12.6%","Japan 10.4%","US 9.5%","Thailand 5.3%","Hong Kong 5.1% (2010 est.)"],"importCommodities":["electronics","machinery","petroleum products","plastics","vehicles","iron and steel products","chemicals"],"importPartners":["China 12.6%","Japan 12.6%","Singapore 11.4%","US 10.7%","Thailand 6.2%","Indonesia 5.6% (2010 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":4312000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":30379000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern system featuring good intercity service on Peninsular Malaysia provided mainly by microwave radio relay and an adequate intercity microwave radio relay network between Sabah and Sarawak via Brunei;
