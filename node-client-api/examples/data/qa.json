{"code":"qa","name":"Qatar","region":"Middle East","background":"Ruled by the Al Thani family since the mid-1800s, Qatar transformed itself from a poor British protectorate noted mainly for pearling into an independent state with significant oil and natural gas revenues. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Qatari economy was crippled by a continuous siphoning off of petroleum revenues by the Amir, who had ruled the country since 1972. His son, the current Amir HAMAD bin Khalifa Al Thani, overthrew him in a bloodless coup in 1995. In 2001, Qatar resolved its longstanding border disputes with both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. As of 2007, oil and natural gas revenues had enabled Qatar to attain the second-highest per capita income in the world.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, peninsula bordering the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":25,"min":30},"E":{"deg":51,"min":15}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":11586,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":11586,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

Qatari authorities throughout the crisis sought to protect the local banking sector with direct investments into domestic banks. GDP rebounded in 2010 largely due to the increase in oil prices. Economic policy is focused on developing Qatar's nonassociated natural gas reserves and increasing private and foreign investment in non-energy sectors, but oil and gas still account for more than 50% of GDP, roughly 85% of export earnings, and 70% of government revenues. Oil and gas likely have made Qatar the highest per-capita income country - ahead of Liechtenstein - and the country with the lowest unemployment. Proved oil reserves of 25 billion barrels should enable continued output at current levels for 57 years. Qatar's proved reserves of natural gas exceed 25 trillion cubic meters, about 14% of the world total and third largest in the world. Qatar's successful 2022 world cup bid will likely accelerate large-scale infrastructure projects such as Qatar's metro system and the Qatar-Bahrain causeway.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":150600000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":129500000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":16.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":78.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":21.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1254000,"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":33,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":44620000000},"expenditures":{"usd":29690000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":10.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":7.04,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":15980000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":65950000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":70900000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":87860000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":27.1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":15110000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":13730000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":1213000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":142000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":753000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":25410000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":76980000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":20200000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":56780000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":25470000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":20110000000},"Exports":{"usd":57820000000},"Imports":{"usd":23380000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":22410000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":71380000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":26380000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":19490000000},"Exchange rates":"Qatari rials (QAR) per US dollar -","industries":["liquefied natural gas, crude oil production and refining, ammonia, fertilizers, petrochemicals, steel reinforcing bars, cement, commercial ship repair"],"agricultureProducts":["fruits","vegetables","poultry","dairy products","beef","fish"],"exportCommodities":["liquefied natural gas (LNG)","petroleum products","fertilizers","steel"],"exportPartners":["Japan 34.68%","South Korea 22.44%","Singapore 10.03%","India 4.86%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","food","chemicals"],"importPartners":["US 13.43%","Italy 8.34%","South Korea 8.33%","Japan 8.04%","Germany 7.31%","France 6.26%","UK 5.59%","China 5%","UAE 4.67%","Saudi Arabia 3.96%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":285300,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2472000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern system centered in Doha","domestic":"combined fixed and mobile-cellular telephone subscribership exceeds 300 telephones per 100 persons","international":"country code - 974;

punishment for offenses related to trafficking in persons remains lower than that for crimes such as rape and kidnapping, and the Qatari government has yet to take significant action to investigate, prosecute, and punish trafficking offenses;
