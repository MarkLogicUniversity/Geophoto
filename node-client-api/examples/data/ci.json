{"code":"ci","name":"Chile","region":"South America","background":"Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the Inca ruled northern Chile while the indigenous Mapuche inhabited central and southern Chile. Although Chile declared its independence in 1810, decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818. In the War of the Pacific (1879-83), Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia and won its present northern regions. It was not until the 1880s that the Mapuche Indians were completely subjugated. After a series of elected governments, the three-year-old Marxist government of Salvador ALLENDE was overthrown in 1973 by a military coup led by Augusto PINOCHET, who ruled until a freely elected president was installed in 1990. Sound economic policies, maintained consistently since the 1980s, have contributed to steady growth, reduced poverty rates by over half, and have helped secure the country's commitment to democratic and representative government. Chile has increasingly assumed regional and international leadership roles befitting its status as a stable, democratic nation.","geo":{"Location":"Southern South America, bordering the South Pacific Ocean, between Argentina and Peru","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":30,"min":0},"W":{"deg":71,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":756102,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":743812,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":12290,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than twice the size of Montana","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":6339,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Argentina 5,308 km, Bolivia 860 km, Peru 171 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":6435,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200/350 nm"},"Terrain":"low coastal mountains;

Exports account for more than one-fourth of GDP, with commodities making up some three-quarters of total exports. Copper alone provides one-third of government revenue. During the early 1990s, Chile's reputation as a role model for economic reform was strengthened when the democratic government of Patricio AYLWIN - which took over from the military in 1990 - deepened the economic reform initiated by the military government. Since 1999, growth has averaged 4% per year. Chile deepened its longstanding commitment to trade liberalization with the signing of a free trade agreement with the US, which took effect on 1 January 2004. Chile claims to have more bilateral or regional trade agreements than any other country. It has 57 such agreements (not all of them full free trade agreements), including with the European Union, Mercosur, China, India, South Korea, and Mexico. Over the past seven years, foreign direct investment inflows have quadrupled to some $15 billion in 2010, but FDI had dropped to about $7 billion in 2009 in the face of diminished investment throughout the world. The Chilean government conducts a rule-based countercyclical fiscal policy, accumulating surpluses in sovereign wealth funds during periods of high copper prices and economic growth, and allowing deficit spending only during periods of low copper prices and growth. As of September 2008, those sovereign wealth funds - kept mostly outside the country and separate from Central Bank reserves - amounted to more than $20 billion. Chile used $4 billion from this fund to finance a fiscal stimulus package to fend off recession. In December 2009, the OECD invited Chile to become a full member, after a two year period of compliance with organization mandates, and in May 2010 Chile signed the OECD Convention, becoming the first South American country to join the OECD. The economy started to show signs of a rebound in the fourth quarter of 2009, and GDP grew more than 5% in 2010. Chile achieved this growth despite the magnitude 8.8 earthquake that struck Chile in February 2010, which was one of the top ten strongest earthquakes on record. The earthquake and subsequent tsunamis it generated caused considerable damage near the epicenter, located about 70 miles from Concepcion - and about 200 miles southwest of Santiago. The Chilean Ministry of Finance estimates the total immediate losses were close to 17% of GDP.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":257899999999.99997},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":203300000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":40.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":53.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":7580000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":13.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":63.9,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":11.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":41.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":52.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":23.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":40970000000},"expenditures":{"usd":45070000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":6.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":7.25,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":29810000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":160300000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":153600000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":209500000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":60600000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":57290000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":1628000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":10850,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":277000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":49250,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":311200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":150000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":1650000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":2340000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":690000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":97970000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":1032999999.9999999},"Exports":{"usd":64280000000},"Imports":{"usd":54230000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":26080000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":84510000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":136300000000.00002},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":51150000000},"Exchange rates":"Chilean pesos (CLP) per US dollar -","industries":["copper, lithium, other minerals, foodstuffs, fish processing, iron and steel, wood and wood products, transport equipment, cement, textiles"],"agricultureProducts":["grapes","apples","pears","onions","wheat","corn","oats","peaches","garlic","asparagus","beans","beef","poultry","wool","fish","timber"],"exportCommodities":["copper","fruit","fish products","paper and pulp","chemicals","wine"],"exportPartners":["China 16.46%","US 11.31%","Japan 9.06%","South Korea 6.49%","Brazil 4.64%","Mexico 4.09%"],"importCommodities":["petroleum and petroleum products","chemicals","electrical and telecommunications equipment","industrial machinery","vehicles","natural gas"],"importPartners":["US 21.77%","China 12.76%","Argentina 9.55%","Brazil 6.46%","South Korea 5.35%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":3575000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":16450000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"privatization begun in 1988;
