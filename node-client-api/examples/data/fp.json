With the halt of French nuclear testing in 1996, the military contribution to the economy fell sharply. Tourism accounts for about one-fourth of GDP and is a primary source of hard currency earnings. Other sources of income are pearl farming and deep-sea commercial fishing. The small manufacturing sector primarily processes agricultural products. The territory benefits substantially from development agreements with France aimed principally at creating new businesses and strengthening social services.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":4718000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":6100000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":76.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":116000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":68,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":11.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":865000000},"expenditures":{"usd":644100000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":650000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":604500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":7000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":6701,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":211000000},"Imports":{"usd":1706000000},"Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Comptoirs Francais du Pacifique francs (XPF) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, pearls, agricultural processing, handicrafts, phosphates"],"agricultureProducts":["fish","coconuts","vanilla","vegetables","fruits","coffee","poultry","beef","dairy products"],"exportCommodities":["cultured pearls","coconut products","mother-of-pearl","vanilla","shark meat"],"importCommodities":["fuels","foodstuffs","machinery and equipment"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":54300,"Telephones - mobile cellular":208300,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"NA","domestic":"combined fixed and mobile-cellular density is roughly 90 per 100 persons","international":"country code - 689; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean) (2009)"},"Broadcast media":"the publicly-owned French Overseas Network (RFO), which operates in France's overseas departments and territories, broadcasts on 2 television channels and 1 radio station; a government-owned TV station is operating; a small number of privately-owned radio stations also broadcast (2008)","Internet country code":".pf","Internet hosts":36056,"Internet users":120000},"transport":{"Airports":53,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":46,"over 3,047 m":2,"1,524 to 2,437 m":4,"914 to 1,523 m":33,"under 914 m":7},"Airports - with unpaved runways":{"total":7,"914 to 1,523 m":3,"under 914 m":4},"Heliports":1,"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":2590,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":1735,"unit":"km"},"unpaved":{"quantity":855,"unit":"km"}},"Merchant marine":{"registered in other countries":"13 (Cambodia 1, France 12) (2010)","country comparison to the world":""},"Ports and terminals":"Papeete"},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces (2011)","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":82722},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":67363,"females age 16-49":66053},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":2498,"female":2390},"Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of France"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
