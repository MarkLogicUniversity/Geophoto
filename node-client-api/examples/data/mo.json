{"code":"mo","name":"Morocco","region":"Africa","background":"In 788, about a century after the Arab conquest of North Africa, successive Moorish dynasties began to rule in Morocco. In the 16th century, the Sa'adi monarchy, particularly under Ahmad AL-MANSUR (1578-1603), repelled foreign invaders and inaugurated a golden age. The Alaouite dynasty, to which the current Moroccan royal family belongs, established a sultanate in Morocco beginning in the 17th century. In 1860, Spain occupied northern Morocco and ushered in a half century of trade rivalry among European powers that saw Morocco's sovereignty steadily erode; in 1912, the French imposed a protectorate over the country. A protracted independence struggle with France ended successfully in 1956. The internationalized city of Tangier and most Spanish possessions were turned over to the new country that same year. Sultan MOHAMMED V, the current monarch's grandfather, organized the new state as a constitutional monarchy and in 1957 assumed the title of king. Morocco annexed Western Sahara during the late 1970s, but final resolution on the status of the territory remains unresolved. Gradual political reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature, which first met in 1997. Under King MOHAMMED VI - who in 1999 succeeded his father to the throne - human rights have improved. Morocco enjoys a moderately free press, but the government occasionally takes action against journalists who report on three broad subjects considered to be taboo: the monarchy, Islam, and the status of Western Sahara. Despite the continuing reforms, ultimate authority remains in the hands of the monarch. Influenced by protests elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa, thousands of Moroccans in February 2011 rallied in Rabat and several other major cities to demand constitutional reform and more democracy and to protest government corruption and high food prices. A number of similar demonstrations and marches continued through March. Police response to most of the protests was subdued compared to the violence noted in protests elsewhere in the region. In early March, in response to demonstrator demands, King MOHAMMED VI announced the formation of a commission to reform the country's constitution. A draft constitution is to be presented by June 2011, followed by a popular referendum. \r\n\r\n","geo":{"Location":"Northern Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, between Algeria and Western Sahara","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":32,"min":0},"W":{"deg":5,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":446550,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":446300,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":250,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than California","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":2017.9,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Algeria 1,559 km, Western Sahara 443 km, Spain (Ceuta) 6.3 km, Spain (Melilla) 9.6 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1835,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"northern coast and interior are mountainous with large areas of bordering plateaus, intermontane valleys, and rich coastal plains","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Sebkha Tah -55 m","highest point":"Jebel Toubkal 4,165 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":79,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":14570,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":29,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":12.6,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":400,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"northern mountains geologically unstable and subject to earthquakes;

Morocco is also the world's largest exporter of phosphate, which has long provided a source of export earnings and economic stability. Economic policies pursued since 2003 by King MOHAMMED VI have brought macroeconomic stability to the country with generally low inflation, improved financial performance, and steady progress in developing the service and industrial sectors. In 2006, Morocco entered a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, and in 2008 entered into an advanced status in its 2000 Association Agreement with the EU. However, poverty, illiteracy, and unemployment rates remain high. In response to these challenges, King MOHAMMED in 2005 launched a National Initiative for Human Development, a $2 billion program aimed at alleviating poverty and underdevelopment by expanding electricity to rural areas and replacing urban slums with public and subsidized housing, among other policies. Morocco's trade and budget deficits widened in 2010, and reducing government spending and adapting to sluggish economic growth in Europe will be challenges in 2011. Morocco's long-term challenges include improving education and job prospects for young Moroccans, closing the disparity in wealth between the rich and the poor, confronting corruption, and expanding and diversifying exports beyond phosphates and low-value-added products.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":151400000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":103500000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":17.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":31.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":51.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":11630000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":44.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":19.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":35.5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":9.8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":33.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":40.9,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":30.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":23420000000},"expenditures":{"usd":27080000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":58.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":3.31,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":67330000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":108700000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":93210000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":62910000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4.4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":19780000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":20780000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":3429000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":4053,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":187000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":17420,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":195800,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":100000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":60000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":560000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1501000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-7.922 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":14490000000},"Imports":{"usd":34189999999.999996},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":24570000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":22690000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":42190000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1046999999.9999999},"Exchange rates":"Moroccan dirhams (MAD) per US dollar -","industries":["phosphate rock mining and processing, food processing, leather goods, textiles, construction, energy, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["barley","wheat","citrus fruits","grapes","vegetables","olives","livestock","wine"],"exportCommodities":["clothing and textiles","electric components","inorganic chemicals","transistors","crude minerals","fertilizers (including phosphates)","petroleum products","citrus fruits","vegetables","fish"],"exportPartners":["Spain 22.02%","France 20.22%","India 4.91%","Italy 4%"],"importCommodities":["crude petroleum","textile fabric","telecommunications equipment","wheat","gas and electricity","transistors","plastics"],"importPartners":["France 16.95%","Spain 14.72%","China 7.1%","Italy 6.76%","Germany 6.28%","US 5.66%","Saudi Arabia 5.11%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":3516000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":25311000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"good system composed of open-wire lines, cables, and microwave radio relay links;
