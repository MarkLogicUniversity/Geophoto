Agriculture, employing more than one-quarter of the working population, provides the economic base with major exports made up of copra and citrus fruit. Black pearls are the Cook Islands' leading export. Manufacturing activities are limited to fruit processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade deficits are offset by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country lived beyond its means, maintaining a bloated public service and accumulating a large foreign debt. Subsequent reforms, including the sale of state assets, the strengthening of economic management, the encouragement of tourism, and a debt restructuring agreement, have rekindled investment and growth.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":183200000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":183200000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":15.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":9.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":75.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":6820,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":29,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":56,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":13.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":70950000},"expenditures":{"usd":69050000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":31000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":28830000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":495,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":26670000},"Exports":{"usd":5222000},"Imports":{"usd":81040000},"Debt - external":{"usd":141000000},"Exchange rates":"NZ dollars (NZD) per US dollar -","industries":["fruit processing, tourism, fishing, clothing, handicrafts"],"agricultureProducts":["copra","citrus","pineapples","tomatoes","beans","pawpaws","bananas","yams","taro","coffee","pigs","poultry"],"exportCommodities":["copra","papayas","fresh and canned citrus fruit","coffee","fish","pearls and pearl shells","clothing"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","textiles","fuels","timber","capital goods"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":6900,"Telephones - mobile cellular":7000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"Telecom Cook Islands offers international direct dialing, Internet, email, fax, and Telex","domestic":"individual islands are connected by a combination of satellite earth stations, microwave systems, and VHF and HF radiotelephone; within the islands, service is provided by small exchanges connected to subscribers by open-wire, cable, and fiber-optic cable","international":"country code - 682; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean)"},"Broadcast media":"1 privately-owned TV station broadcasts from Rarotonga providing a mix of local news and overseas-sourced programs; a satellite program package is available; 6 radio stations broadcast with 1 reportedly reaching all of the islands (2009)","Internet country code":".ck","Internet hosts":2521,"Internet users":6000},"transport":{"Airports":10,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":1,"1,524 to 2,437 m":1},"Airports - with unpaved runways":{"total":9,"1,524 to 2,437 m":2,"914 to 1,523 m":5,"under 914 m":2},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":320,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":33,"unit":"km"},"unpaved":{"quantity":287,"unit":"km"}},"Merchant marine":{"total":34,"country comparison to the world":"","by type":"bulk carrier 1, cargo 27, passenger 1, refrigerated cargo 5","foreign-owned":"23 (Egypt 1, Germany 1, Latvia 1, Lithuania 2, former Netherlands Antilles 1, Norway 6, NZ 1, Russia 1, Sweden 3, Turkey 4, UK 2) (2010)"},"Ports and terminals":"Avatiu"},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces; National Police Department (2009)","Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":2198,"females age 16-49":2156},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":127,"female":107},"Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of New Zealand in consultation with the Cook Islands and at its request"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
