Fishing, offshore financial services, and tourism, with nearly 197,000 visitors in 2008, are other mainstays of the economy. Mineral deposits are negligible; the country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from import duties. Economic development is hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances from main markets and between constituent islands. In response to foreign concerns, the government has promised to tighten regulation of its offshore financial center. In mid-2002, the government stepped up efforts to boost tourism through improved air connections, resort development, and cruise ship facilities. Agriculture, especially livestock farming, is a second target for growth. Australia and New Zealand are the main suppliers of tourists and foreign aid.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1137000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":693000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":62,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":115900,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":65,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":78700000},"expenditures":{"usd":72230000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":229200000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":614200000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":274000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Electricity - production":{"quantity":42000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":39060000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":653.6,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-60 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":40000000},"Imports":{"usd":156000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":40540000},"Debt - external":{"usd":81200000},"Exchange rates":"vatu (VUV) per US dollar -","industries":["food and fish freezing, wood processing, meat canning"],"agricultureProducts":["copra","coconuts","cocoa","coffee","taro","yams","fruits","vegetables","beef","fish"],"exportCommodities":["copra","beef","cocoa","timber","kava","coffee"],"exportPartners":["Thailand 53.15%","Japan 12.22%","Poland 11.78%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","foodstuffs","fuels"],"importPartners":["Japan 17.3%","Australia 13.46%","China 12.26%","Singapore 12%","NZ 6.88%","Poland 6.61%","France 5.86%","Fiji 5.52%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":7200,"Telephones - mobile cellular":126500,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"NA","domestic":"NA","international":"country code - 678; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean)"},"Broadcast media":"1 state-owned television station; multi-channel pay TV is available; state-owned Radio Vanuatu operates 2 radio stations; 2 privately-owned radio broadcasters; programming from multiple international broadcasters is accessible (2008)","Internet country code":".vu","Internet hosts":1347,"Internet users":17000},"transport":{"Airports":31,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":3,"2,438 to 3,047 m":1,"1,524 to 2,437 m":1,"914 to 1,523 m":1},"Airports - with unpaved runways":{"total":28,"914 to 1,523 m":5,"under 914 m":23},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":1070,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":256,"unit":"km"},"unpaved":{"quantity":814,"unit":"km"}},"Merchant marine":{"total":72,"country comparison to the world":"","by type":"bulk carrier 35, cargo 5, container 1, liquefied gas 2, passenger 2, refrigerated cargo 26, vehicle carrier 1","foreign-owned":"70 (Australia 2, Belgium 1, Canada 5, Greece 4, Japan 44, Monaco 1, Norway 1, Poland 7, Russia 1, UAE 1, Ukraine 3) (2010)"},"Ports and terminals":"Forari Bay, Luganville (Santo, Espiritu Santo), Port-Vila"},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces; Vanuatu Police Force (VPF), Vanuatu Mobile Force (VMF; includes Police Maritime Wing (PMW)) (2009)","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":62216},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":43331,"females age 16-49":44927},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":2323,"female":2230},"Military expenditures":"NA"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["Matthew and Hunter Islands east of New Caledonia claimed by Vanuatu and France"]}}
