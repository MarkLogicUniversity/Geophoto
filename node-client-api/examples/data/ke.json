{"code":"ke","name":"Kenya","region":"Africa","background":"Founding president and liberation struggle icon Jomo KENYATTA led Kenya from independence in 1963 until his death in 1978, when President Daniel Toroitich arap MOI took power in a constitutional succession. The country was a de facto one-party state from 1969 until 1982 when the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) made itself the sole legal party in Kenya. MOI acceded to internal and external pressure for political liberalization in late 1991. The ethnically fractured opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power in elections in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by violence and fraud, but were viewed as having generally reflected the will of the Kenyan people. President MOI stepped down in December 2002 following fair and peaceful elections. Mwai KIBAKI, running as the candidate of the multiethnic, united opposition group, the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC), defeated KANU candidate Uhuru KENYATTA and assumed the presidency following a campaign centered on an anticorruption platform. KIBAKI's NARC coalition splintered in 2005 over a constitutional review process. Government defectors joined with KANU to form a new opposition coalition, the Orange Democratic Movement, which defeated the government's draft constitution in a popular referendum in November 2005. KIBAKI's reelection in December 2007 brought charges of vote rigging from ODM candidate Raila ODINGA and unleashed two months of violence in which as many as 1,500 people died. UN-sponsored talks in late February produced a powersharing accord bringing ODINGA into the government in the restored position of prime minister. Kenya in August 2010 adopted a new constitution that eliminates the role of prime minister after the next presidential election.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Africa, bordering the Indian Ocean, between Somalia and Tanzania","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":1,"min":0},"E":{"deg":38,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":580367,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":569140,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":11227,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than twice the size of Nevada","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":3477,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Ethiopia 861 km, Somalia 682 km, Sudan 232 km, Tanzania 769 km, Uganda 933 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":536,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"low plains rise to central highlands bisected by Great Rift Valley;

In 1997, the IMF suspended Kenya's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Program due to the government's failure to maintain reforms and curb corruption. The IMF, which had resumed loans in 2000 to help Kenya through a drought, again halted lending in 2001 when the government failed to institute several anticorruption measures. In the key December 2002 elections, Daniel Arap MOI's 24-year-old reign ended, and a new opposition government took on the formidable economic problems facing the nation. After some early progress in rooting out corruption and encouraging donor support, the KIBAKI government was rocked by high-level graft scandals in 2005 and 2006. In 2006, the World Bank and IMF delayed loans pending action by the government on corruption. The international financial institutions and donors have since resumed lending, despite little action on the government's part to deal with corruption. Post-election violence in early 2008, coupled with the effects of the global financial crisis on remittance and exports, reduced GDP growth to 1.7 in 2008, but the economy rebounded in 2009-10.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":66030000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":32159999999.999996},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":62,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":17940000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":75,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":37.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":42.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":7017000000},"expenditures":{"usd":9045000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":50.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":14.8,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":6333000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":15380000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":14110000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":10760000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":5223000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":4863000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":58300000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":22500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":76000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":7270,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":80530,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.414 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":5141000000},"Imports":{"usd":10400000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":4585000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":7935000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":2337000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":338000000},"Exchange rates":"Kenyan shillings (KES) per US dollar -","industries":["small-scale consumer goods (plastic, furniture, batteries, textiles, clothing, soap, cigarettes, flour), agricultural products, horticulture, oil refining","aluminum, steel, lead","cement, commercial ship repair, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["tea","coffee","corn","wheat","sugarcane","fruit","vegetables","dairy products","beef","pork","poultry","eggs"],"exportCommodities":["tea","horticultural products","coffee","petroleum products","fish","cement"],"exportPartners":["UK 11.31%","Netherlands 9.81%","Uganda 9.07%","Tanzania 8.83%","US 5.93%","Pakistan 5.63%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transportation equipment","petroleum products","motor vehicles","iron and steel","resins and plastics"],"importPartners":["India 11.67%","China 10.58%","UAE 9.32%","South Africa 8.36%","Saudi Arabia 6.53%","US 6.25%","Japan 5.1%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":664100,"Telephones - mobile cellular":19365000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"inadequate;
