In 1991 the two nations signed a friendship and cooperation treaty, but tensions have flared up intermittently since then. Yahya JAMMEH led a military coup in 1994 that overthrew the president and banned political activity. A new constitution and presidential elections in 1996, followed by parliamentary balloting in 1997, completed a nominal return to civilian rule. JAMMEH has been elected president in all subsequent elections including most recently in late 2006.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean and Senegal","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":13,"min":28},"W":{"deg":16,"min":34}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":11295,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":10000,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":1295,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

About three-quarters of the population depends on the agricultural sector for its livelihood. Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts, fish, and hides. The Gambia's natural beauty and proximity to Europe has made it one of the larger markets for tourism in West Africa, boosted by government and private sector investments in eco-tourism and upscale facilities. In the past few years, The Gambia's re-export trade - traditionally a major segment of economic activity - has declined, but its banking sector has grown rapidly. Unemployment and underemployment rates remain high; economic progress depends on sustained bilateral and multilateral aid, on responsible government economic management, and on continued technical assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors. The quality of fiscal management, however, is weak. The government has promised to raise civil service wages over the next two years and the deficit is projected to worsen.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":3494000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1067000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":30.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":16.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":53.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":777100,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":75,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":36.9,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":50.2,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":28,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":183900000},"expenditures":{"usd":202500000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":27,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":222900000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":453900000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":293500000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8.9,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":160000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":148800000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":41.62,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2266,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-90 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":107000000},"Imports":{"usd":306000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":203000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":530000000},"Exchange rates":"dalasis (GMD) per US dollar -","industries":["processing peanuts, fish, and hides","tourism, beverages, agricultural machinery assembly, woodworking, metalworking, clothing"],"agricultureProducts":["rice","millet","sorghum","peanuts","corn","sesame","cassava (tapioca)","palm kernels","cattle","sheep","goats"],"exportCommodities":["peanut products","fish","cotton lint","palm kernels"],"exportPartners":["India 42.06%","France 15.34%","UK 9.03%","China 7.38%","Hong Kong 4.55%","Belgium 3.97%"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","manufactures","fuel","machinery and transport equipment"],"importPartners":["China 20.45%","Senegal 11.97%","Brazil 8.48%","Cote d'Ivoire 4.71%","Netherlands 4.68%","US 4.49%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":49000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":1433000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"adequate microwave radio relay and open-wire network;
