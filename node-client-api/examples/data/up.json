{"code":"up","name":"Ukraine","region":"Europe","background":"Ukraine was the center of the first eastern Slavic state, Kyivan Rus, which during the 10th and 11th centuries was the largest and most powerful state in Europe. Weakened by internecine quarrels and Mongol invasions, Kyivan Rus was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and eventually into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The cultural and religious legacy of Kyivan Rus laid the foundation for Ukrainian nationalism through subsequent centuries. A new Ukrainian state, the Cossack Hetmanate, was established during the mid-17th century after an uprising against the Poles. Despite continuous Muscovite pressure, the Hetmanate managed to remain autonomous for well over 100 years. During the latter part of the 18th century, most Ukrainian ethnographic territory was absorbed by the Russian Empire. Following the collapse of czarist Russia in 1917, Ukraine was able to achieve a short-lived period of independence (1917-20), but was reconquered and forced to endure a brutal Soviet rule that engineered two forced famines (1921-22 and 1932-33) in which over 8 million died. In World War II, German and Soviet armies were responsible for some 7 to 8 million more deaths. Although final independence for Ukraine was achieved in 1991 with the dissolution of the USSR, democracy and prosperity remained elusive as the legacy of state control and endemic corruption stalled efforts at economic reform, privatization, and civil liberties. A peaceful mass protest \"Orange Revolution\" in the closing months of 2004 forced the authorities to overturn a rigged presidential election and to allow a new internationally monitored vote that swept into power a reformist slate under Viktor YUSHCHENKO. Subsequent internal squabbles in the YUSHCHENKO camp allowed his rival Viktor YANUKOVYCH to stage a comeback in parliamentary elections and become prime minister in August of 2006. An early legislative election, brought on by a political crisis in the spring of 2007, saw Yuliya TYMOSHENKO, as head of an \"Orange\" coalition, installed as a new prime minister in December 2007. Viktor YANUKOVUYCH was elected president in a February 2010 run-off election that observers assessed as meeting most international standards. The following month, the Rada approved a vote of no-confidence prompting Yuliya TYMOSHENKO to resign from her post as prime minister.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Europe, bordering the Black Sea, between Poland, Romania, and Moldova in the west and Russia in the east","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":49,"min":0},"E":{"deg":32,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":603550,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":579330,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":24220,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Texas","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":4566,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Belarus 891 km, Hungary 103 km, Moldova 940 km, Poland 428 km, Romania (south) 176 km, Romania (southwest) 362 km, Russia 1,576 km, Slovakia 90 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2782,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"most of Ukraine consists of fertile plains (steppes) and plateaus, mountains being found only in the west (the Carpathians), and in the Crimean Peninsula in the extreme south","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Black Sea 0 m","highest point":"Hora Hoverla 2,061 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":53.8,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":44.7,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":21790,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":139.5,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":37.53,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":807,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"NA","internationalEnvironmentAgreements":{"signed, but not ratified":"Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulfur 94, Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds","partyTo":["Air Pollution","Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides","Air Pollution-Sulfur 85","Antarctic-Environmental Protocol","Antarctic-Marine Living Resources","Antarctic Treaty","Biodiversity","Climate Change","Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol","Desertification","Endangered Species","Environmental Modification","Hazardous Wastes","Law of the Sea","Marine Dumping","Ozone Layer Protection","Ship Pollution","Wetlands"]},"naturalResources":["iron ore","coal","manganese","natural gas","oil","salt","sulfur","graphite","titanium","magnesium","kaolin","nickel","mercury","timber","arable land"],"environmentalIssues":["inadequate supplies of potable water","air and water pollution","deforestation","radiation contamination in the northeast from 1986 accident at Chornobyl' Nuclear Power Plant"],"climate":["temperate continental","Mediterranean only on the southern Crimean coast","precipitation disproportionately distributed, highest in west and north, lesser in east and southeast","winters vary from cool along the Black Sea to cold farther inland","summers are warm across the greater part of the country, hot in the south"],"geographyNote":["strategic position at the crossroads between Europe and Asia","second-largest country in Europe"]},"people":{"Population":45134,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":13.7,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":70.8,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"15.5% (male 2,294,777/female 4,682,865) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":39.9,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":36.7,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":43.1,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":"-0.622% (2011 est.)","Birth rate":{"quantity":9.62,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":15.74,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":"-0.09 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2011 est.)","Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":69,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":"-0.1% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Major cities - population":"KYIV (capital) 2.779 million;

Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied the unique equipment (for example, large diameter pipes) and raw materials to industrial and mining sites (vertical drilling apparatus) in other regions of the former USSR. Shortly after independence in August 1991, the Ukrainian Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal framework for privatization, but widespread resistance to reform within the government and the legislature soon stalled reform efforts and led to some backtracking. Output by 1999 had fallen to less than 40% of the 1991 level. Ukraine's dependence on Russia for energy supplies and the lack of significant structural reform have made the Ukrainian economy vulnerable to external shocks. Ukraine depends on imports to meet about three-fourths of its annual oil and natural gas requirements and 100% of its nuclear fuel needs. After a two-week dispute that saw gas supplies cutoff to Europe, Ukraine agreed to 10-year gas supply and transit contracts with Russia in January 2009 that brought gas prices to \"world\" levels. The strict terms of the contracts have further hobbled Ukraine's cash-strapped state gas company, Naftohaz. Outside institutions - particularly the IMF - have encouraged Ukraine to quicken the pace and scope of reforms. Ukrainian Government officials eliminated most tax and customs privileges in a March 2005 budget law, bringing more economic activity out of Ukraine's large shadow economy, but more improvements are needed, including fighting corruption, developing capital markets, and improving the legislative framework. Ukraine's economy was buoyant despite political turmoil between the prime minister and president until mid-2008. Real GDP growth exceeded 7% in 2006-07, fueled by high global prices for steel - Ukraine's top export - and by strong domestic consumption, spurred by rising pensions and wages. Ukraine reached an agreement with the IMF for a $16.4 billion Stand-By Arrangement in November 2008 to deal with the economic crisis, but the Ukrainian Government's lack of progress in implementing reforms has twice delayed the release of IMF assistance funds. The drop in steel prices and Ukraine's exposure to the global financial crisis due to aggressive foreign borrowing lowered growth in 2008 and the economy contracted more than 15% in 2009, among the worst economic performances in the world; growth resumed in 2010, buoyed by exports. External conditions are likely to hamper efforts for economic recovery in 2011.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":305200000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":136400000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":9.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":32.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":57.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":22060000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":15.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":18.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":65.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.4,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":35,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":25.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":31,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":16.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":41180000000},"expenditures":{"usd":49790000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":38.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":9.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":10.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":20.86,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":34970000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":73910000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":110800000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":16790000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":172900000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":134600000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":4000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":99930,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":348000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":154400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":147600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":395000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":21200000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":52000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":5000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":26830000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1104000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":603000000},"Exports":{"usd":49710000000},"Imports":{"usd":53540000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":32909999999.999996},"Debt - external":{"usd":97500000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":52310000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":2327000000},"Exchange rates":"hryvnia (UAH) per US dollar -","industries":["coal, electric power, ferrous and nonferrous metals, machinery and transport equipment, chemicals, food processing"],"agricultureProducts":["grain","sugar beets","sunflower seeds","vegetables","beef","milk"],"exportCommodities":["ferrous and nonferrous metals","fuel and petroleum products","chemicals","machinery and transport equipment","food products"],"exportPartners":["Russia 21.1%","Turkey 5.3%","China 3.8% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["energy","machinery and equipment","chemicals"],"importPartners":["Russia 28%","Germany 8.6%","China 6.1%","Kazakhstan 4.9%","Poland 4.9% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":13026000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":55333000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"Ukraine's telecommunication development plan emphasizes improving domestic trunk lines, international connections, and the mobile-cellular system","domestic":"at independence in December 1991, Ukraine inherited a telephone system that was antiquated, inefficient, and in disrepair;
