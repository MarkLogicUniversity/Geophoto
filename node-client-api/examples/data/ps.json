Business and tourist arrivals numbered 85,000 in 2007. The population enjoys a per capita income roughly 50% higher than that of the Philippines and much of Micronesia. Long-run prospects for the key tourist sector have been greatly bolstered by the expansion of air travel in the Pacific, the rising prosperity of leading East Asian countries, and the willingness of foreigners to finance infrastructure development.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":164000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":164000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"NA% (2009)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":6.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":81.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":9777,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"industry":"NA%","services":"NA% (1990)"},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":114800000},"expenditures":{"usd":99500000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Current account balance":{"usd":15090000},"Exports":{"usd":5882000},"Imports":{"usd":107300000},"Debt - external":{"usd":null},"Exchange rates":"the US dollar is used","industries":["tourism, craft items (from shell, wood, pearls), construction, garment making"],"agricultureProducts":["coconuts","copra","cassava (tapioca)","sweet potatoes","fish"],"exportCommodities":["shellfish","tuna","copra","garments"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","fuels","metals","foodstuffs"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":7100,"Telephones - mobile cellular":13200,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"NA","domestic":"fixed-line and mobile-cellular services available with a combined subscribership of roughly 100 per 100 persons","international":"country code - 680; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean) (2008)"},"Broadcast media":"no television broadcast stations; a cable television network covers the major islands and provides access to rebroadcasts, on a delayed basis, of a number of US stations as well as access to a number of real-time satellite TV channels; about a half dozen radio stations with 1 government-owned (2009)","Internet country code":".pw","Internet hosts":3},"transport":{"Airports":3,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":1,"1,524 to 2,437 m":1},"Airports - with unpaved runways":{"total":2,"1,524 to 2,437 m":2},"Ports and terminals":"Koror"},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces; Palau National Police (2009)","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":6987},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":5272,"females age 16-49":3969},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":216,"female":222},"Military expenditures":"NA","Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of the US; under a Compact of Free Association between Palau and the US, the US military is granted access to the islands for 50 years, but it has not stationed any military forces there (2008)"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["maritime delineation negotiations continue with Philippines, Indonesia"]}}
