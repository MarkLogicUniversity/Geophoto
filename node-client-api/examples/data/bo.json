It has retained closer political and economic ties to Russia than any of the other former Soviet republics. Belarus and Russia signed a treaty on a two-state union on 8 December 1999 envisioning greater political and economic integration. Although Belarus agreed to a framework to carry out the accord, serious implementation has yet to take place. Since his election in July 1994 as the country's first president, Aleksandr LUKASHENKO has steadily consolidated his power through authoritarian means. Government restrictions on freedom of speech and the press, peaceful assembly, and religion remain in place.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Europe, east of Poland","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":53,"min":0},"E":{"deg":28,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":207600,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":202900,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":4700,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

overview":"Belarus has seen limited structural reform since 1995, when President LUKASHENKO launched the country on the path of \"market socialism.\" In keeping with this policy, LUKASHENKO reimposed administrative controls over prices and currency exchange rates and expanded the state's right to intervene in the management of private enterprises. Since 2005, the government has re-nationalized a number of private companies. In addition, businesses have been subjected to pressure by central and local governments, including arbitrary changes in regulations, numerous rigorous inspections, retroactive application of new business regulations, and arrests of \"disruptive\" businessmen and factory owners. Continued state control over economic operations hampers market entry for businesses, both domestic and foreign. Government statistics indicate GDP growth was strong, surpassing 10% in 2008, despite the roadblocks of a tough, centrally directed economy with a high rate of inflation and a low rate of unemployment. However, the global crisis pushed the country into recession in 2009, and GDP grew only 0.2% for the year. Slumping foreign demand hit the industrial sector hard. Minsk has depended on a standby-agreement with the IMF to assist with balance of payments shortfalls. In line with IMF conditions, in 2009, Belarus devalued the ruble more than 40% and tightened some fiscal and monetary policies. On 1 January 2010, Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus launched a customs union, with unified trade regulations and customs codes still under negotiation. In late January, Russia and Belarus amended their 2007 oil supply agreement. The new terms raised prices for above quota purchases, increasing Belarus' current account deficit. GDP grew 4.8% in 2010, in part, on the strength of renewed export growth. In December 2010, Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan signed an agreement to form a Common Economic Space and Russia removed all Belarusian oil duties.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":131199999999.99998},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":54710000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":42.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":48.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5000000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":34.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":51.3,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":27.1,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":27.9,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":36,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":23270000000},"expenditures":{"usd":24320000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":13.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.68,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4747000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":13620000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":19990000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":10.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":29920000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":30540000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":5062000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":9406000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":31400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":173000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":303900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":444800,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":198000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":152000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":17000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":17600000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":2832000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-5.062 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":24490000000},"Imports":{"usd":29790000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":5755000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":24800000000},"Exchange rates":"Belarusian rubles (BYB/BYR) per US dollar -","industries":["metal-cutting machine tools, tractors, trucks, earthmovers, motorcycles, televisions, synthetic fibers, fertilizer, textiles, radios, refrigerators"],"agricultureProducts":["grain","potatoes","vegetables","sugar beets","flax","beef","milk"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and equipment","mineral products","chemicals","metals","textiles","foodstuffs"],"exportPartners":["Russia 33.6%","Netherlands 13.78%","Ukraine 8.68%","Latvia 6.32%","Poland 4.19%","Germany 4.17%"],"importCommodities":["mineral products","machinery and equipment","chemicals","foodstuffs","metals"],"importPartners":["Russia 56.42%","Germany 8.31%","Ukraine 4.79%","China 4.04%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":3969000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":9686000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"Belarus lags behind its neighbors in upgrading telecommunications infrastructure;
