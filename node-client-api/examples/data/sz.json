{"code":"sz","name":"Switzerland","region":"Europe","background":"The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive alliance among three cantons. In succeeding years, other localities joined the original three. The Swiss Confederation secured its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499. A constitution of 1848, subsequently modified in 1874, replaced the confederation with a centralized federal government. Switzerland's sovereignty and neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers, and the country was not involved in either of the two world wars. The political and economic integration of Europe over the past half century, as well as Switzerland's role in many UN and international organizations, has strengthened Switzerland's ties with its neighbors. However, the country did not officially become a UN member until 2002. Switzerland remains active in many UN and international organizations but retains a strong commitment to neutrality.","geo":{"Location":"Central Europe, east of France, north of Italy","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":47,"min":0},"E":{"deg":8,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":41277,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":39997,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":1280,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than twice the size of New Jersey","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1852,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Austria 164 km, France 573 km, Italy 740 km, Liechtenstein 41 km, Germany 334 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"mostly mountains (Alps in south, Jura in northwest) with a central plateau of rolling hills, plains, and large lakes","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Lake Maggiore 195 m","highest point":"Dufourspitze 4,634 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":9.91,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.58,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":89.51,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":250,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":53.3,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":2.52,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":348,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"avalanches, landslides;

Switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector, led by financial services, and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology, knowledge-based production. The Swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the EU's, in order to enhance their international competitiveness, but some trade protectionism remains, particularly for its small agricultural sector. The global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put Switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled. The Swiss National Bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc. Switzerland's economy grew by 2.7% in 2010, when Bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program, but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges. The country's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008-09, leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008. Switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries, the EU, the US, and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws. Consequently, the government agreed to conform to OECD regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters, including tax evasion. The government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries, including the US, to incorporate the OECD standard, and it is working with Germany and the UK to resolve outstanding issues, particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners. Parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements, including that with the US, in March 2010. The agreement with the US awaits US Senate approval. In 2009, Swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to reveal at Washington's behest the names of US account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud. These steps will have a lasting impact on Switzerland's long history of bank secrecy.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":324500000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":523799999999.99994},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":27.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":71.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4620000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":3.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":23.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":73.2,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":6.9,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":33.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":188100000000},"expenditures":{"usd":192700000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":38.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":0.04,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":0.54,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":384200000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":834600000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":879700000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1071000000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":66500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":57500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":54200000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":52000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":3488,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":280000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":10680,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":263600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":3042000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":3042000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":49350000000},"Exports":{"usd":232600000000},"Imports":{"usd":226300000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":236600000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1200000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":514000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":814600000000},"Exchange rates":"Swiss francs (CHF) per US dollar -","industries":["machinery, chemicals, watches, textiles, precision instruments, tourism, banking, and insurance"],"agricultureProducts":["grains","fruits","vegetables","meat","eggs"],"exportCommodities":["machinery","chemicals","metals","watches","agricultural products"],"exportPartners":["Germany 20.98%","US 9.09%","France 8.62%","Italy 8.08%","Austria 5.38%"],"importCommodities":["machinery","chemicals","vehicles","metals","agricultural products","textiles"],"importPartners":["Germany 27.19%","Italy 10.42%","US 9.61%","France 7.69%","Netherlands 4.35%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":4650000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":9255000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"highly developed telecommunications infrastructure with excellent domestic and international services","domestic":"ranked among leading countries for fixed-line teledensity and infrastructure;
