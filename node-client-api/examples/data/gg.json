{"code":"gg","name":"Georgia","region":"Middle East","background":"The region of present day Georgia contained the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Kartli-Iberia. The area came under Roman influence in the first centuries A.D. and Christianity became the state religion in the 330s. Domination by Persians, Arabs, and Turks was followed by a Georgian golden age (11th-13th centuries) that was cut short by the Mongol invasion of 1236. Subsequently, the Ottoman and Persian empires competed for influence in the region. Georgia was absorbed into the Russian Empire in the 19th century. Independent for three years (1918-1921) following the Russian revolution, it was forcibly incorporated into the USSR until the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. An attempt by the incumbent Georgian government to manipulate national legislative elections in November 2003 touched off widespread protests that led to the resignation of Eduard SHEVARDNADZE, president since 1995. New elections in early 2004 swept Mikheil SAAKASHVILI into power along with his United National Movement party. Progress on market reforms and democratization has been made in the years since independence, but this progress has been complicated by Russian assistance and support to the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. After a series of Russian and separatist provocations in summer 2008, Georgian military action in South Ossetia in early August led to a Russian military response that not only occupied the breakaway areas, but large portions of Georgia proper as well. Russian troops pulled back from most occupied Georgian territory, but in late August 2008 Russia unilaterally recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This action was strongly condemned by most of the world's nations and international organizations.","geo":{"Location":"Southwestern Asia, bordering the Black Sea, between Turkey and Russia, with a sliver of land north of the Caucasus extending into Europe","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":42,"min":0},"E":{"deg":43,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":69700,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":69700,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

overview":"Georgia's economy sustained GDP growth of more than 10% in 2006-07, based on strong inflows of foreign investment and robust government spending. However, GDP growth slowed in 2008 following the August 2008 conflict with Russia, and turned negative in 2009 as foreign direct investment and workers' remittances declined in the wake of the global financial crisis, but rebounded in 2010. Georgia's main economic activities include the cultivation of agricultural products such as grapes, citrus fruits, and hazelnuts; mining of manganese and copper; and output of a small industrial sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, metals, machinery, aircraft and chemicals. Areas of recent improvement include growth in the construction, banking services, and mining sectors, but reduced availability of external investment and the slowing regional economy are emerging risks. The country imports nearly all its needed supplies of natural gas and oil products. It has sizeable hydropower capacity, a growing component of its energy supplies. Georgia has overcome the chronic energy shortages and gas supply interruptions of the past by renovating hydropower plants and by increasingly relying on natural gas imports from Azerbaijan instead of from Russia. The construction on the Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline, and the Kars-Akhalkalaki Railroad are part of a strategy to capitalize on Georgia's strategic location between Europe and Asia and develop its role as a transit point for gas, oil and other goods. Georgia has historically suffered from a chronic failure to collect tax revenues; however, the government, since coming to power in 2004, has simplified the tax code, improved tax administration, increased tax enforcement, and cracked down on petty corruption. However, the economic downturn of 2008-09 eroded the tax base and led to a decline in the budget surplus and an increase in public borrowing needs. The country is pinning its hopes for renewed growth on a determined effort to continue to liberalize the economy by reducing regulation, taxes, and corruption in order to attract foreign investment, but the economy faces a more difficult investment climate both domestically and internationally.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":22440000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":11670000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":27.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":62,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1918000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":55.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":8.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":35.5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":16.4,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":31,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":30.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":40.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":14.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":3172000000},"expenditures":{"usd":3915000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"}},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":25.52,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1175000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2146000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":3243000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":733300000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":7970000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":6902000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":628000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":430000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":994.9,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":13000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1486,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":16590,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":35000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":8000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":1730000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1720000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":8494999999.999999,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.404 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":2290000000},"Imports":{"usd":4828000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2350000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":3381000000},"Exchange rates":"laris (GEL) per US dollar -","industries":["steel, aircraft, machine tools, electrical appliances, mining (manganese and copper), chemicals, wood products, wine"],"agricultureProducts":["citrus","grapes","tea","hazelnuts","vegetables","livestock"],"exportCommodities":["scrap metal","wine","mineral water","ores","vehicles","fruits and nuts"],"exportPartners":["Turkey 17.87%","Azerbaijan 12.3%","Bulgaria 9.6%","Canada 8.78%","UK 7.49%","Ukraine 6.82%","Spain 5.27%","US 4.99%"],"importCommodities":["fuels","vehicles","machinery and parts","grain and other foods","pharmaceuticals"],"importPartners":["Turkey 16.81%","Azerbaijan 9.72%","Ukraine 9.17%","Russia 7.39%","US 6.63%","Germany 6.22%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":620000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2837000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"fixed-line telecommunications network has only limited coverage outside Tbilisi;
