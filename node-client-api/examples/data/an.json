{"code":"an","name":"Andorra","region":"Europe","background":"For 715 years, from 1278 to 1993, Andorrans lived under a unique co-principality, ruled by French and Spanish leaders (from 1607 onward, the French chief of state and the Spanish bishop of Seu d'Urgell). In 1993, this feudal system was modified with the titular heads of state retained, but the government transformed into a parliamentary democracy. For decades Andorra enjoyed its status as a small refuge of fiscal and banking freedom and benefitted from Spanish and French tourists attracted to the country's duty-free shopping. The situation has changed in recent years as Andorra started to tax foreign investment and other sectors. Tourism accounts for over 80% of Andorra's gross domestic product.","geo":{"Location":"Southwestern Europe, Pyrenees mountains, on the border between France and Spain","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":42,"min":30},"E":{"deg":1,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":468,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":468,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"2.5 times the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":120.3,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"France 56.6 km, Spain 63.7 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"rugged mountains dissected by narrow valleys","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Riu Runer 840 m","highest point":"Pic de Coma Pedrosa 2,946 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":2.13,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":97.87,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":"NA","Natural hazards":"avalanches","internationalEnvironmentAgreements":{"signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements","partyTo":["Biodiversity","Desertification","Hazardous Wastes","Ozone Layer Protection"]},"naturalResources":["hydropower","mineral water","timber","iron ore","lead"],"environmentalIssues":["deforestation","overgrazing of mountain meadows contributes to soil erosion","air pollution","wastewater treatment and solid waste disposal"],"climate":["temperate","snowy, cold winters and warm, dry summers"],"geographyNote":["landlocked","straddles a number of important crossroads in the Pyrenees"]},"people":{"Population":84825,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":15.6,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":71.4,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"13% (male 5,502/female 5,502) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":40.5,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":40.8,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":40.2,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":0.33,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":9.66,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":6.35,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":{"quantity":0,"unit":"migrant(s)/1,000 population"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":88,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Major cities - population":"ANDORRA LA VELLA (capital) 25,000 (2009)","Sex ratio":{"at birth":{"quantity":1.066,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years":{"quantity":1.06,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":1.09,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over":{"quantity":0.99,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population":{"quantity":1.07,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":3.76,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"female":{"quantity":3.84,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"}},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":{"quantity":82.43,"unit":"years"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":80.35,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":84.64,"unit":"years"}},"Total fertility rate":{"quantity":1.35,"unit":"children born/woman"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":"NA","HIV/AIDS - deaths":"NA","Drinking water source":{},"Sanitation facility access":{},"Nationality":{"noun":"Andorran(s)","adjective":"Andorran"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"},"male":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"},"female":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"}},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":{"quantity":12,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":11,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":12,"unit":"years"}},"Education expenditures":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"ethnicGroups":["Spanish 43%","Andorran 33%","Portuguese 11%","French 7%","other 6% (1998)"],"religions":["Roman Catholic (predominant)"],"languages":["Catalan (official)","French","Castilian","Portuguese"]},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"Principality of Andorra","conventional short form":"Andorra","local long form":"Principat d'Andorra","local short form":"Andorra"},"Government type":"parliamentary democracy (since March 1993) that retains as its chiefs of state a coprincipality;

An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status for some products and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative advantage eroded when the borders of neighboring France and Spain opened, providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs. The banking sector also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited - only 2% of the land is arable - and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing output and exports consist mainly of perfumes and cosmetic products, products of the printing industry, electrical machinery and equipment, clothing, tobacco products, and furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":3300000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":"$NA","GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":"NA%"},"Labor force":38220,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":4.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":94.9,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA (2008)","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":872000000},"expenditures":{"usd":868400000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":101000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":598700000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":9000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":497700000,"unit":"kWh"}},"Exports":{"usd":64000000},"Imports":{"usd":1474000000},"Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism (particularly skiing), cattle raising, timber, banking, tobacco, furniture"],"agricultureProducts":["small quantities of rye","wheat","barley","oats","vegetables","sheep"],"exportCommodities":["tobacco products","furniture"],"importCommodities":["consumer goods","food","electricity"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":37900,"Telephones - mobile cellular":64500,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern automatic telephone system","domestic":"modern system with microwave radio relay connections between exchanges","international":"country code - 376; landline circuits to France and Spain"},"Broadcast media":"1 public television station and 2 public radio stations; about 10 commercial radio stations operating; good reception of radio and TV broadcasts from stations in France and Spain; upgraded to terrestrial digital television broadcasting in 2007; roughly 25 international television channels available (2010)","Internet country code":".ad","Internet hosts":26773,"Internet users":67100},"transport":{"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":320,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":""}},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces, Police Service of Andorra (2010)","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":22390},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":17977,"females age 16-49":17069},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":397,"female":347},"Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of France and Spain"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
