{"code":"cs","name":"Costa Rica","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Although explored by the Spanish early in the 16th century, initial attempts at colonizing Costa Rica proved unsuccessful due to a combination of factors, including: disease from mosquito-infested swamps, brutal heat, resistance by natives, and pirate raids. It was not until 1563 that a permanent settlement of Cartago was established in the cooler, fertile central highlands. The area remained a colony for some two and a half centuries. In 1821, Costa Rica became one of several Central American provinces that jointly declared their independence from Spain. Two years later it joined the United Provinces of Central America, but this federation disintegrated in 1838, at which time Costa Rica proclaimed its sovereignty and independence. Since the late 19th century, only two brief periods of violence have marred the country's democratic development. In 1949, Costa Rica dissolved its armed forces. Although it still maintains a large agricultural sector, Costa Rica has expanded its economy to include strong technology and tourism industries. The standard of living is relatively high. Land ownership is widespread.","geo":{"Location":"Central America, bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Pacific Ocean, between Nicaragua and Panama","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":10,"min":0},"W":{"deg":84,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":51100,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":51060,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":40,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than West Virginia","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":639,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Nicaragua 309 km, Panama 330 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1290,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"coastal plains separated by rugged mountains including over 100 volcanic cones, of which several are major volcanoes","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Cerro Chirripo 3,810 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":4.4,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":5.87,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":89.73,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":1080,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":112.4,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":2.68,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":619,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"occasional earthquakes, hurricanes along Atlantic coast;

The economy contracted 0.7% in 2009, but resumed growth at more than 3% in 2010. While the traditional agricultural exports of bananas, coffee, sugar, and beef are still the backbone of commodity export trade, a variety of industrial and specialized agricultural products have broadened export trade in recent years. High value added goods and services, including microchips, have further bolstered exports. Tourism continues to bring in foreign exchange, as Costa Rica's impressive biodiversity makes it a key destination for ecotourism. Foreign investors remain attracted by the country's political stability and relatively high education levels, as well as the fiscal incentives offered in the free-trade zones; and Costa Rica has attracted one of the highest levels of foreign direct investment per capita in Latin America. However, many business impediments, such as high levels of bureaucracy, difficulty of enforcing contracts, and weak investor protection, remain. Poverty has remained around 15-20% for nearly 20 years, and the strong social safety net that had been put into place by the government has eroded due to increased financial constraints on government expenditures. Unlike the rest of Central America, Costa Rica is not highly dependent on remittances as they only represent about 2% of GDP. Immigration from Nicaragua has increasingly become a concern for the government. The estimated 300,000-500,000 Nicaraguans in Costa Rica legally and illegally are an important source of - mostly unskilled - labor, but also place heavy demands on the social welfare system. The US-Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) entered into force on 1 January 2009, after significant delays within the Costa Rican legislature. CAFTA-DR will likely lead to increased foreign direct investment in key sectors of the economy, including the insurance and telecommunications sectors recently opened to private investors. President CHINCHILLA is likely to push for fiscal reform in the coming year, seeking to boost revenue, possibly through revised tax legislation, to fund an increase in security services and education.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":51170000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":35780000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":6.3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":22.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":70.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":2170000,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":64,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":35.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":48,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":5085000000},"expenditures":{"usd":6921000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":42.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":17.4,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4504000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":16809999999.999998},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":15820000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1452000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":9290000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":8250000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":77160000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":203200000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":44000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2117,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":46260,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.349 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":10010000000},"Imports":{"usd":13320000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":4584000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":8550000000.000001},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":13920000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":547000000},"Exchange rates":"Costa Rican colones (CRC) per US dollar -","industries":["microprocessors, food processing, medical equipment, textiles and clothing, construction materials, fertilizer, plastic products"],"agricultureProducts":["bananas","pineapples","coffee","melons","ornamental plants","sugar","corn","rice","beans","potatoes","beef","poultry","dairy","timber"],"exportCommodities":["bananas","pineapples","coffee","melons","ornamental plants","sugar","beef","seafood","electronic components","medical equipment"],"exportPartners":["US 32.61%","Netherlands 12.82%","China 11.81%","Mexico 4.2%"],"importCommodities":["raw materials","consumer goods","capital equipment","petroleum","construction materials"],"importPartners":["US 44.72%","Mexico 7.65%","Venezuela 5.56%","China 5.15%","Japan 4.36%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1493000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":1950000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"good domestic telephone service in terms of breadth of coverage;
