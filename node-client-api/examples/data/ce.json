{"code":"ce","name":"Sri Lanka","region":"South Asia","background":"The first Sinhalese arrived in Sri Lanka late in the 6th century B.C., probably from northern India. Buddhism was introduced in about the mid-third century B.C., and a great civilization developed at the cities of Anuradhapura (kingdom from circa 200 B.C. to circa A.D. 1000) and Polonnaruwa (from about 1070 to 1200). In the 14th century, a south Indian dynasty established a Tamil kingdom in northern Sri Lanka. The coastal areas of the island were controlled by the Portuguese in the 16th century and by the Dutch in the 17th century. The island was ceded to the British in 1796, became a crown colony in 1802, and was formally united under British rule by 1815. As Ceylon, it became independent in 1948; its name was changed to Sri Lanka in 1972. Tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil separatists erupted into war in 1983. After two decades of fighting, the government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) formalized a cease-fire in February 2002 with Norway brokering peace negotiations. Violence between the LTTE and government forces intensified in 2006, but the government regained control of the Eastern Province in 2007. By May 2009, the government announced that its military had defeated the remnants of the LTTE. Since the end of the conflict, the government has resettled tens of thousands of internally displaced persons and has undertaken a number of massive infrastructure projects to reconstruct its economy.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Asia, island in the Indian Ocean, south of India","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":7,"min":0},"E":{"deg":81,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":65610,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":64630,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":980,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

Additionally, Sri Lanka seeks to reduce poverty by using a combination of state directed policies and private investment promotion to spur growth in disadvantaged areas, develop small and medium enterprises, and promote increased agriculture. High levels of government funding may be difficult, as the government already is faced with high debt interest payments, a bloated civil service, and historically high budget deficits. The 2008-09 global financial crisis and recession exposed Sri Lanka's economic vulnerabilities and nearly caused a balance of payments crisis, which was alleviated by a $2.6 billion IMF standby agreement in July 2009. The end of the civil war and the IMF loan, however, have largely restored investors' confidence, reflected in part by the Sri Lankan stock market's recognition as one of the best performing markets in the world. Sri Lankan growth rates averaged nearly 5% in during the war, but increased government spending on development and fighting the LTTE in the final years spurred GDP growth to around 6-7% per year in 2006-08. After experiencing 3.5% growth in 2009, Sri Lanka's economy is poised to achieve high growth rates in the postwar period.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":106500000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":49680000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":9.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":12.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":29.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":57.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":8100000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":32.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":26.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":41,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.4,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":39.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":49,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":23.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":7415000000},"expenditures":{"usd":11180000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":86.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.91,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4400000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":19720000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":18340000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":8132999999.999999},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6.9,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":9901000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":8417000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":90000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":968.4,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":87690,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.784 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":7908000000},"Imports":{"usd":11600000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":5630000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":17970000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Sri Lankan rupees (LKR) per US dollar -","industries":["processing of rubber, tea, coconuts, tobacco and other agricultural commodities","telecommunications, insurance, banking","tourism, shipping","clothing, textiles","cement, petroleum refining, information technology services, construction"],"agricultureProducts":["rice","sugarcane","grains","pulses","oilseed","spices","vegetables","fruit","tea","rubber","coconuts","milk","eggs","hides","beef","fish"],"exportCommodities":["textiles and apparel","tea and spices","rubber manufactures","precious stones","coconut products","fish"],"exportPartners":["US 20.59%","UK 12.87%","Italy 5.51%","Germany 5.29%","India 4.54%","Belgium 4.43%"],"importCommodities":["petroleum","textiles","machinery and transportation equipment","building materials","mineral products","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["India 20.73%","China 13.45%","Singapore 7.26%","Iran 6.7%","South Korea 5.23%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":3523000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":15868000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"telephone services have improved significantly and are available in most parts of the country","domestic":"national trunk network consists mostly of digital microwave radio relay;
