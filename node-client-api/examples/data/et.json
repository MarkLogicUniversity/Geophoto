{"code":"et","name":"Ethiopia","region":"Africa","background":"Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian monarchy maintained its freedom from colonial rule with the exception of a short-lived Italian occupation from 1936-41. In 1974, a military junta, the Derg, deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE (who had ruled since 1930) and established a socialist state. Torn by bloody coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems, the regime was finally toppled in 1991 by a coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). A constitution was adopted in 1994, and Ethiopia's first multiparty elections were held in 1995. A border war with Eritrea late in the 1990s ended with a peace treaty in December 2000. In November 2007, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Border Commission remotely demarcated the border by geographical coordinates, but final demarcation of the boundary on the ground is currently on hold because of Ethiopian objections to an international commission's finding requiring it to surrender territory considered sensitive to Ethiopia.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Africa, west of Somalia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":8,"min":0},"E":{"deg":38,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":1104,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":1000000,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":104300,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

The agricultural sector suffers from frequent drought and poor cultivation practices. Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian economy with exports of some $350 million in 2006, but historically low prices have seen many farmers switching to qat to supplement income. Under Ethiopia's constitution, the state owns all land and provides long-term leases to the tenants; the system continues to hamper growth in the industrial sector as entrepreneurs are unable to use land as collateral for loans. In November 2001, Ethiopia qualified for debt relief from the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, and in December 2005 the IMF forgave Ethiopia's debt. The global economic downturn led to balance of payments pressures, partially alleviated by recent emergency funding from the IMF. While GDP growth has remained high, per capita income is among the lowest in the world.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":86120000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":29720000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":42.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":13.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":43.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":37900000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":85,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":38.7,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":25.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":30,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":25.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":4360000000},"expenditures":{"usd":5098000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":39.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4764000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":8247999999.999999},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":8661000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":9.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":3460000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":3130000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":38000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":33590,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":430000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":24920000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.232 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1729000000},"Imports":{"usd":7517000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1880000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":4288999999.9999995},"Exchange rates":"birr (ETB) per US dollar -","industries":["food processing, beverages, textiles, leather, chemicals, metals processing, cement"],"agricultureProducts":["cereals","pulses","coffee","oilseed","cotton","sugarcane","potatoes","qat","cut flowers","hides","cattle","sheep","goats","fish"],"exportCommodities":["coffee","qat","gold","leather products","live animals","oilseeds"],"exportPartners":["China 10.87%","Germany 9.75%","Saudi Arabia 7.39%","US 7.21%","Netherlands 6.38%","Switzerland 5.33%","Sudan 4.35%","Belgium 4%"],"importCommodities":["food and live animals","petroleum and petroleum products","chemicals","machinery","motor vehicles","cereals","textiles"],"importPartners":["China 14.73%","Saudi Arabia 8.41%","India 7.65%","US 4.3%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":915100,"Telephones - mobile cellular":4051999.9999999995,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"inadequate telephone system with the Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation (ETC) maintaining a monopoly over telecommunication services;
