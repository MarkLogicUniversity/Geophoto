{"code":"cc","name":"Curacao","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Originally settled by Arawak Indians, Curacao was seized by the Dutch in 1634 along with the neighboring island of Bonaire. Once the center of the Caribbean slave trade, Curacao was hard hit by the abolition of slavery in 1863. Its prosperity (and that of neighboring Aruba) was restored in the early 20th century with the construction of the Isla Refineria to service the newly discovered Venezuelan oil fields. In 1954, Curacao and several other Dutch Caribbean possessions were reorganized as the Netherlands Antilles, part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In referenda in 2005 and 2009, the citizens of Curacao voted to become a self-governing country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The change in status became effective in October of 2010 with the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.","geo":{"Location":"Caribbean, an island in the Caribbean Sea - 55 km off the coast of Venezuela","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":12,"min":10},"W":{"deg":69,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":444,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":444,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"more than two times the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":364,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive fishing zone":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"generally low, hilly terrain","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caribbean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Mt.

Although GDP grew slightly during the past decade, the island enjoys a high per capita income and a well-developed infrastructure compared with other countries in the region. Curacao has an excellent natural harbor that can accommodate large oil tankers. The Venezuelan state oil company leases the single refinery on the island from the government; most of the oil for the refinery is imported from Venezuela; most of the refined products are exported to the US. Almost all consumer and capital goods are imported, with the US, Brazil, Italy, and Mexico being the major suppliers. The government is attempting to diversify its industry and trade and has signed an Association Agreement with the EU to expand business there. Poor soils and inadequate water supplies hamper the development of agriculture. Budgetary problems complicate reform of the health and pension systems for an aging population.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":2838000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5080000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":84,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":63000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":16.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":81.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":10.3,"unit":"%"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Exports":{"Exports":{"usd":876000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Imports":{"usd":1340000000},"Exchange rates":"Netherlands Antillean guilders (ANG) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, petroleum refining, petroleum transshipment facilities, light manufacturing"],"agricultureProducts":["aloe","sorghum","peanuts","vegetables","tropical fruit"],"exportCommodities":["petroleum products"],"exportPartners":["US 13.1%","Guatemala 10.8%","Singapore 10.7%","Dominican Republic 9.6%","Haiti 7.6%","The Bahamas 6.1%","Honduras 4.5%","Mexico 4.2% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["crude petroleum","food","manufactures"],"importPartners":["Venezuela 57.3%","US 19.2%","Brazil 8.1% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":"NA","Telephones - mobile cellular":"NA","Telephone system":{"general assessment":"NA","domestic":"NA","international":"country code - 599"},"Broadcast media":"government-run Telecuracao operates a TV station and a radio station; several privately-owned radio stations","Internet country code":".cw","Internet hosts":"NA","Internet users":"NA"},"transport":{"Airports":1,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":1,"over 3,047 m":1},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":550,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Ports and terminals":"Bullen Baai, Fuik Bay, Willemstad"},"military":{"Military branches":"the Royal Netherlands Navy maintains a permanent and active presence in the region from its main operating base on Curacao; other local security forces include a coast guard, paramilitary National Guard (Vrijwilligers Korps Curacao), and Police Force (2010)","Military service age and obligation":"no conscription (2010)","Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of the Kingdom of the Netherlands"},"issues":{}}
