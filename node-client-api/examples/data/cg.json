{"code":"cg","name":"Congo, Democratic Republic of the","region":"Africa","background":"Established as a Belgian colony in 1908, the then-Republic of the Congo gained its independence in 1960, but its early years were marred by political and social instability. Col. Joseph MOBUTU seized power and declared himself president in a November 1965 coup. He subsequently changed his name - to MOBUTU Sese Seko - as well as that of the country - to Zaire. MOBUTU retained his position for 32 years through several sham elections, as well as through brutal force. Ethnic strife and civil war, touched off by a massive inflow of refugees in 1994 from fighting in Rwanda and Burundi, led in May 1997 to the toppling of the MOBUTU regime by a rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda and fronted by Laurent KABILA. He renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but in August 1998 his regime was itself challenged by a second insurrection again backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Troops from Angola, Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe intervened to support KABILA's regime. A cease-fire was signed in July 1999 by the DRC, Congolese armed rebel groups, Angola, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe but sporadic fighting continued. Laurent KABILA was assassinated in January 2001 and his son, Joseph KABILA, was named head of state. In October 2002, the new president was successful in negotiating the withdrawal of Rwandan forces occupying eastern Congo; two months later, the Pretoria Accord was signed by all remaining warring parties to end the fighting and establish a government of national unity. A transitional government was set up in July 2003. Joseph KABILA as president and four vice presidents represented the former government, former rebel groups, the political opposition, and civil society. The transitional government held a successful constitutional referendum in December 2005 and elections for the presidency, National Assembly, and provincial legislatures in 2006. The National Assembly was installed in September 2006 and KABILA was inaugurated president in December 2006. Provincial assemblies were constituted in early 2007, and elected governors and national senators in January 2007. The next national elections are scheduled for November 2011.","geo":{"Location":"Central Africa, northeast of Angola","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":0,"min":0},"E":{"deg":25,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":2344,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":2267,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":77810,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than one-fourth the size of the US","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":10730,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Angola 2,511 km (of which 225 km is the boundary of Angola's discontiguous Cabinda Province), Burundi 233 km, Central African Republic 1,577 km, Republic of the Congo 2,410 km, Rwanda 217 km, Sudan 628 km, Tanzania 459 km, Uganda 765 km, Zambia 1,930 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":37,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":"boundaries with neighbors"},"Terrain":"vast central basin is a low-lying plateau;

Systemic corruption since independence in 1960 and conflict that began in May 1997 has dramatically reduced national output and government revenue, increased external debt, and resulted in the deaths of more than 5 million people from violence, famine, and disease. Foreign businesses curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict, lack of infrastructure, and the difficult operating environment. Conditions began to improve in late 2002 with the withdrawal of a large portion of the invading foreign troops. The transitional government reopened relations with international financial institutions and international donors, and President KABILA began implementing reforms. Progress has been slow and the International Monetary Fund curtailed their program for the DRC at the end of March 2006 because of fiscal overruns. Much economic activity still occurs in the informal sector, and is not reflected in GDP data. Renewed activity in the mining sector, the source of most export income, boosted Kinshasa's fiscal position and GDP growth from 2006-2008, however, the government's review of mining contracts that began in 2006, combined with a fall in world market prices for the DRC's key mineral exports temporarily weakened output in 2009, leading to a balance of payments crisis. The recovery in mineral prices beginning in mid 2009 boosted mineral exports, and emergency funds from the IMF boosted foreign reserves. An uncertain legal framework, corruption, and a lack of transparency in government policy are long-term problems for the mining sector and for the economy as a whole. The global recession cut economic growth in 2009 to less than half its 2008 level, but growth returned to 6% in 2010. The DRC signed a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the IMF in 2009 and received $12 billion in multilateral and bilateral debt relief in 2010.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":23120000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":13130000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":37.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":36.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":23530000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":"NA%"},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":71,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":34.7,"unit":"%"}},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":700000000},"expenditures":{"usd":2000000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":26.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":65.42,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":613900000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1562000000},"Stock of domestic credit":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":8217000000.000001,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":5997000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":1916000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":6000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":16360,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":10000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":20090,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":11350,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":180000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":991100000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.47 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":3800000000},"Imports":{"usd":5300000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1010000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":13500000000},"Exchange rates":"Congolese francs (CDF) per US dollar -","industries":["mining (diamonds, gold, copper, cobalt, coltan, zinc, tin, diamonds), mineral processing, consumer products (including textiles, plastics, footwear, cigarettes, metal products, processed foods and beverages), timber, cement, commercial ship repair"],"agricultureProducts":["coffee","sugar","palm oil","rubber","tea","cotton","cocoa","quinine","cassava (tapioca)","manioc","bananas","plantains","peanuts","root crops","corn","fruits","wood products"],"exportCommodities":["diamonds","gold","copper","cobalt","wood products","crude oil","coffee"],"exportPartners":["China 46.75%","US 15.35%","Belgium 10.68%","Zambia 5.78%","Finland 4.38%"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","mining and other machinery","transport equipment","fuels"],"importPartners":["South Africa 18.22%","Belgium 10.2%","China 8.34%","Zambia 7.77%","France 7.28%","Zimbabwe 6.52%","Kenya 5.48%","Netherlands 4.13%","Italy 3.96%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":40000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":10163000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"barely adequate wire and microwave radio relay service in and between urban areas;
