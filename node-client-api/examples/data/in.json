{"code":"in","name":"India","region":"South Asia","background":"The Indus Valley civilization, one of the world's oldest, flourished during the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C. and extended into northwestern India. Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated onto the Indian subcontinent about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. The Maurya Empire of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached its zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia. The Golden Age ushered in by the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a flowering of Indian science, art, and culture. Islam spread across the subcontinent over a period of 700 years. In the 10th and 11th centuries, Turks and Afghans invaded India and established the Delhi Sultanate. In the early 16th century, the Emperor BABUR established the Mughal Dynasty which ruled India for more than three centuries. European explorers began establishing footholds in India during the 16th century. By the 19th century, Great Britain had become the dominant political power on the subcontinent. The British Indian Army played a vital role in both World Wars. Nonviolent resistance to British rule, led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU, eventually brought about independence in 1947. Communal violence led to the subcontinent's bloody partition, which resulted in the creation of two separate states, India and Pakistan. The two countries have fought three wars since independence, the last of which in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. India's nuclear weapons tests in 1998 caused Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year. In November 2008, terrorists allegedly originating from Pakistan conducted a series of coordinated attacks in Mumbai, India's financial capital. Despite pressing problems such as significant overpopulation, environmental degradation, extensive poverty, and widespread corruption, rapid economic development is fueling India's rise on the world stage. In January 2011, India assumed a nonpermanent seat in the UN Security Council for the 2011-12 term.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Asia, bordering the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, between Burma and Pakistan","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":20,"min":0},"E":{"deg":77,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":3287,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":2973,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":314070,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than one-third the size of the US","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":14103,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Bangladesh 4,053 km, Bhutan 605 km, Burma 1,463 km, China 3,380 km, Nepal 1,690 km, Pakistan 2,912 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":7000,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"upland plain (Deccan Plateau) in south, flat to rolling plain along the Ganges, deserts in west, Himalayas in north","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Indian Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Kanchenjunga 8,598 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":48.83,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":48.37,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":622860,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":1907.8,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":645.84,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":585,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"droughts;

Economic liberalization, including industrial deregulation, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and reduced controls on foreign trade and investment, began in the early 1990s and has served to accelerate the country's growth, which has averaged more than 7% per year since 1997. India's diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a multitude of services. Slightly more than half of the work force is in agriculture, but services are the major source of economic growth, accounting for more than half of India's output, with only one-third of its labor force. India has capitalized on its large educated English-speaking population to become a major exporter of information technology services and software workers. In 2010, the Indian economy rebounded robustly from the global financial crisis - in large part because of strong domestic demand - and growth exceeded 8% year-on-year in real terms. Merchandise exports, which account for about 15% of GDP, returned to pre-financial crisis levels. An industrial expansion and high food prices, resulting from the combined effects of the weak 2009 monsoon and inefficiencies in the government's food distribution system, fueled inflation which peaked at about 11% in the first half of 2010, but has gradually decreased to single digits following a series of central bank interest rate hikes. In 2010 New Delhi reduced subsidies for fuel and fertilizers, sold a small percentage of its shares in some state-owned enterprises and auctioned off rights to radio bandwidth for 3G telecommunications in part to lower the government's deficit. The Indian Government seeks to reduce its budget deficit to 5.5% of GDP in FY 2010-11, down from 6.8% in the previous fiscal year. India's long term challenges include widespread poverty, inadequate physical and social infrastructure, limited non-agricultural employment opportunities, insufficient access to quality basic and higher education, and accommodating rural-to-urban migration.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":4059999999999.9995},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1538000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":10.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":16.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":28.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":55.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":478300000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":52,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":34,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":10.8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":31.1,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":36.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":32,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":170700000000},"expenditures":{"usd":268000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":55.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":11.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":12.19,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":328400000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1290000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1164000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1179000000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":9.7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":723800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":568000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":810000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":5270000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":878700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2980000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":738600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2900000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":5800000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":38650000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":51270000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":12620000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1075000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-26.91 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":201000000000},"Imports":{"usd":327000000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":284100000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":237100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":191100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":89040000000},"Exchange rates":"Indian rupees (INR) per US dollar -","industries":["textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel, transportation equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, software, pharmaceuticals"],"agricultureProducts":["rice","wheat","oilseed","cotton","jute","tea","sugarcane","lentils","onions","potatoes","dairy products","sheep","goats","poultry","fish"],"exportCommodities":["petroleum products","precious stones","machinery","iron and steel","chemicals","vehicles","apparel"],"exportPartners":["UAE 12.87%","US 12.59%","China 5.59%"],"importCommodities":["crude oil","precious stones","machinery","fertilizer","iron and steel","chemicals"],"importPartners":["China 10.94%","US 7.16%","Saudi Arabia 5.36%","UAE 5.18%","Australia 5.02%","Germany 4.86%","Singapore 4.02%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":35770000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":670000000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"supported by recent deregulation and liberalization of telecommunications laws and policies, India has emerged as one of the fastest growing telecom markets in the world;
