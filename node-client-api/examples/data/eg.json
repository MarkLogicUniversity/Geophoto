{"code":"eg","name":"Egypt","region":"Africa","background":"The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed for the development of one of the world's great civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Following the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt became an important world transportation hub, but also fell heavily into debt. Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty with the overthrow of the British-backed monarchy in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress society. The government has struggled to meet the demands of Egypt's growing population through economic reform and massive investment in communications and physical infrastructure.","geo":{"Location":"Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Libya and the Gaza Strip, and the Red Sea north of Sudan, and includes the Asian Sinai Peninsula","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":27,"min":0},"E":{"deg":30,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":1001,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":995450,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":6000,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than three times the size of New Mexico","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":2665,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Gaza Strip 11 km, Israel 266 km, Libya 1,115 km, Sudan 1,273 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2450,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"vast desert plateau interrupted by Nile valley and delta","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Qattara Depression -133 m","highest point":"Mount Catherine 2,629 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":2.92,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":96.58,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":35300,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":86.8,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":68.3,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":923,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"periodic droughts;

Egypt's economy was highly centralized during the rule of former President Gamal Abdel NASSER but opened up considerably under former Presidents Anwar EL-SADAT and Mohamed Hosni MUBARAK. Cairo from 2004 to 2008 aggressively pursued economic reforms to attract foreign investment and facilitate GDP growth. The global financial crisis slowed the reform efforts. The budget deficit climbed to over 8% of GDP and Egypt's GDP growth slowed to 4.6% in 2009, predominately due to reduced growth in export-oriented sectors, including manufacturing and tourism, and Suez Canal revenues. In 2010, the government spent more on infrastructure and public projects, and exports drove GDP growth to more than 5%, but GDP growth in 2011 is unlikely to bounce back to pre-global financial recession levels, when it stood at 7%. Despite the relatively high levels of economic growth over the past few years, living conditions for the average Egyptian remain poor.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":497800000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":218500000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":13.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":37.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":48.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":26100000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":32,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":51,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":9.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":27.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":34.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":46820000000},"expenditures":{"usd":64190000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":80.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":12.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.98,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":37800000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":166200000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":145600000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":89950000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":118400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":104100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":814000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":251000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":680500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":683000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":89300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":48450,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":4300000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":62700000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":42500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":8550000000.000001,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1656000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":270000000},"Exports":{"usd":25340000000},"Imports":{"usd":46520000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":35720000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":30610000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":72410000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":4900000000},"Exchange rates":"Egyptian pounds (EGP) per US dollar -","industries":["textiles, food processing, tourism, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, hydrocarbons, construction, cement, metals, light manufactures"],"agricultureProducts":["cotton","rice","corn","wheat","beans","fruits","vegetables","cattle","water buffalo","sheep","goats"],"exportCommodities":["crude oil and petroleum products","cotton","textiles","metal products","chemicals","processed food"],"exportPartners":["US 7.95%","Italy 7.26%","Spain 6.78%","India 6.69%","Saudi Arabia 5.53%","Syria 5.3%","France 4.39%","South Korea 4.27%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","foodstuffs","chemicals","wood products","fuels"],"importPartners":["US 9.92%","China 9.63%","Germany 6.98%","Italy 6.88%","Turkey 4.94%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":10313000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":55352000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"underwent extensive upgrading during 1990s;
