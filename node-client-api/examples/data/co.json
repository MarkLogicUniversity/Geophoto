{"code":"co","name":"Colombia","region":"South America","background":"Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others are Ecuador and Venezuela). A four-decade long conflict between government forces and anti-government insurgent groups, principally the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) heavily funded by the drug trade, escalated during the 1990s. The insurgents lack the military or popular support necessary to overthrow the government, and violence has been decreasing since about 2002. However, insurgents continue attacks against civilians and large areas of the countryside are under guerrilla influence or are contested by security forces. More than 31,000 former paramilitaries had demobilized by the end of 2006 and the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) as a formal organization had ceased to function. In the wake of the paramilitary demobilization, emerging criminal groups arose, whose members include some former paramilitaries. The Colombian Government has stepped up efforts to reassert government control throughout the country, and now has a presence in every one of its administrative departments. However, neighboring countries worry about the violence spilling over their borders. In January 2011, Colombia assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011-12 term.","geo":{"Location":"Northern South America, bordering the Caribbean Sea, between Panama and Venezuela, and bordering the North Pacific Ocean, between Ecuador and Panama","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":4,"min":0},"W":{"deg":72,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":1138,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":1038,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":100210,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than twice the size of Texas","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":6309,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Brazil 1,644 km, Ecuador 590 km, Panama 225 km, Peru 1,800 km, Venezuela 2,050 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":3208,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"flat coastal lowlands, central highlands, high Andes Mountains, eastern lowland plains","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Pico Cristobal Colon 5,775 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":2.01,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":1.37,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":96.62,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":9000,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":2132,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":10.71,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":235,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"highlands subject to volcanic eruptions;

agriculture; infrastructure; housing; and innovation. Colombia is third largest exporter of oil to the United States. President SANTOS, inaugurated in August 2010, introduced unprecedented legislation to better distribute extractive industry royalties and compensate Colombians who lost their land due to decades of violence. He also seeks to build on improvements in domestic security and on President URIBE's promarket economic policies. Foreign direct investment reached a record $10 billion in 2008, but dropped to $7.2 billion in 2009, before beginning to recover in 2010, notably in the oil sector. Pro-business reforms in the oil and gas sectors and export-led growth, fueled mainly by the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, have enhanced Colombia's investment climate. Inequality, underemployment, and narcotrafficking remain significant challenges, and Colombia's infrastructure requires major improvements to sustain economic expansion. Because of the global financial crisis and weakening demand for Colombia's exports, Colombia's economy grew only 2.7% in 2008, and 0.8% in 2009 but rebounded to around 4.4% in 2010. In late 2010, Colombia experienced its most severe flooding in decades, with damages estimated to exceed $6 billion. The government has encouraged exporters to diversify their customer base beyond the United States and Venezuela, traditionally Colombia's largest trading partners; the SANTOS administration continues to pursue free trade agreements with Asian and South American partners and a trade accord with Canada is expected to go into effect in 2011, while a negotiated trade agreement with the EU has yet to be approved by the EU parliament. Improved relations with Venezuela have eased worries about restrictions on bilateral trade, but the business sector remains concerned about the pending US Congressional approval of the US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":435400000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":285500000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":9.3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":38,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":52.7,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":21270000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":68,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":11.8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":45.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":0.8,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":45,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":58.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":74200000000},"expenditures":{"usd":83900000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":44.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":12.98,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":31830000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":104900000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":123000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":217300000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":50580000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":38590000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":876700000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":39400000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":785000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":288000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":294000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":16540,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1900000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":9000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":8100000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":900000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":112000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-5.946 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":40240000000},"Imports":{"usd":36260000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":28500000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":57740000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":84620000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":19200000000},"Exchange rates":"Colombian pesos (COP) per US dollar -","industries":["textiles, food processing, oil, clothing and footwear, beverages, chemicals, cement","gold, coal, emeralds"],"agricultureProducts":["coffee","cut flowers","bananas","rice","tobacco","corn","sugarcane","cocoa beans","oilseed","vegetables","forest products","shrimp"],"exportCommodities":["petroleum","coffee","coal","nickel","emeralds","apparel","bananas","cut flowers"],"exportPartners":["US 42%","EU 12.6%","China 5.2%","Ecuador 4.5% (2010 est.)"],"importCommodities":["industrial equipment","transportation equipment","consumer goods","chemicals","paper products","fuels","electricity"],"importPartners":["US 25.5%","China 13.4%","Mexico 9.4%","Brazil 5.9%","Germany 4.1% (2010 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":7500000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":42160000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern system in many respects with a nationwide microwave radio relay system, a domestic satellite system with 41 earth stations, and a fiber-optic network linking 50 cities;
