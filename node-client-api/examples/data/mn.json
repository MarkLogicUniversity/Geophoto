The current ruling Grimaldi family first seized temporary control in 1297, and again in 1331, but were not able to permanently secure their holding until 1419. Economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with a railroad linkup to France and the opening of a casino. Since then, the principality's mild climate, splendid scenery, and gambling facilities have made Monaco world famous as a tourist and recreation center.","geo":{"Location":"Western Europe, bordering the Mediterranean Sea on the southern coast of France, near the border with Italy","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":43,"min":44},"E":{"deg":7,"min":24}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":2,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":2,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"about three times the size of The Mall in Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":4.4,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"France 4.4 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"hilly, rugged, rocky","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Mediterranean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Mont Agel 140 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":"100% (urban area) (2005)"},"Irrigated land":"NA","Natural hazards":"NA","internationalEnvironmentAgreements":{"signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements","partyTo":["Air Pollution","Air Pollution-Sulfur 94","Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds","Biodiversity","Climate Change","Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol","Desertification","Endangered Species","Hazardous Wastes","Law of the Sea","Marine Dumping","Ozone Layer Protection","Ship Pollution","Wetlands","Whaling"]},"naturalResources":["none"],"environmentalIssues":["NA"],"climate":["Mediterranean with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers"],"geographyNote":["second-smallest independent state in the world (after Holy See)","almost entirely urban"]},"people":{"Population":30539,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":12.3,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":60.8,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"26.9% (male 3,640/female 4,562) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":49.4,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":48.4,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":50.5,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":"-0.124% (2011 est.)","Birth rate":{"quantity":6.94,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":8.28,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"migrant(s)/1,000 population"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":100,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":0.3,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":{"quantity":1.039,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years":{"quantity":1.05,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":1,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over":{"quantity":0.8,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population":{"quantity":0.95,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":{"quantity":1.79,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":2.04,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"female":{"quantity":1.54,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"}},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":{"quantity":89.73,"unit":"years"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":85.77,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":93.84,"unit":"years"}},"Total fertility rate":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"children born/woman"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":"NA","HIV/AIDS - deaths":"NA","Drinking water source":{},"Sanitation facility access":{},"Nationality":{"noun":"Monegasque(s) or Monacan(s)","adjective":"Monegasque or Monacan"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":{"quantity":99,"unit":"%"},"male":{"quantity":99,"unit":"%"},"female":{"quantity":99,"unit":"%"}},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":{"quantity":18,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":18,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":17,"unit":"years"}},"Education expenditures":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"ethnicGroups":["French 47%","Monegasque 16%","Italian 16%","other 21%"],"religions":["Roman Catholic 90%","other 10%"],"languages":["French (official)","English","Italian","Monegasque"]},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"Principality of Monaco","conventional short form":"Monaco","local long form":"Principaute de Monaco","local short form":"Monaco"},"Government type":"constitutional monarchy","Capital":{"name":"Monaco","geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":43,"min":44},"E":{"deg":7,"min":25}},"time difference":"UTC+1 (6 hours ahead of Washington, DC during Standard Time)","daylight saving time":"+1hr, begins last Sunday in March;

The principality also is a major banking center and has successfully sought to diversify into services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The state has no income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices. Monaco, however, is not a tax-free shelter; it charges nearly 20% value-added tax, collects stamp duties, and companies face a 33% tax on profits unless they can show that three-quarters of profits are generated within the principality. Monaco was formally removed from the OECD's \"grey list\" of uncooperative tax jurisdictions in late 2009, but continues to face international pressure to abandon its banking secrecy laws and help combat tax evasion. The state retains monopolies in a number of sectors, including tobacco, the telephone network, and the postal service. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":976300000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":"$NA","GDP - real growth rate":"NA%","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":4.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":95.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":44000,"country comparison to the world":""},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":863000000},"expenditures":{"usd":920600000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - consumption":"NA kWh","Electricity - imports":"NA kWh; note - electricity supplied by France","Exports":{"Exports":{"usd":716300000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Imports":{"Imports":{"usd":916100000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Debt - external":{"usd":18000000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, construction, small-scale industrial and consumer products"],"agricultureProducts":["none"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":35400,"Telephones - mobile cellular":23000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern automatic telephone system; the country's sole fixed line operator offers a full range of services to residential and business customers","domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity exceeds 100%","international":"country code - 377; no satellite earth stations; connected by cable into the French communications system"},"Broadcast media":"TV Monte-Carlo (TMC) operates a TV network; Radio Monte-Carlo has both an Italian-language and a French-language network; a few private radio stations operating (2008)","Internet country code":".mc","Internet hosts":23621,"Internet users":23000},"transport":{"Heliports":1,"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":50,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":50,"unit":"km"}},"Merchant marine":{"registered in other countries":"68 (Bahamas 14, Bermuda 2, Comoros 1, Cyprus 1, Liberia 10, Marshall Islands 21, Norway 1, Panama 14, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 3, Vanuatu 1) (2010)","country comparison to the world":""},"Ports and terminals":"Monaco"},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces; the Palace Guard performs ceremonial duties","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":5749},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":4629,"females age 16-49":4597},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":153,"female":141},"Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of France"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
