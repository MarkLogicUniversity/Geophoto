{"code":"pm","name":"Panama","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Explored and settled by the Spanish in the 16th century, Panama broke with Spain in 1821 and joined a union of Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela - named the Republic of Gran Colombia. When the latter dissolved in 1830, Panama remained part of Colombia. With US backing, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and promptly signed a treaty with the US allowing for the construction of a canal and US sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the structure (the Panama Canal Zone). The Panama Canal was built by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. In 1977, an agreement was signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from the US to Panama by the end of the century. Certain portions of the Zone and increasing responsibility over the Canal were turned over in the subsequent decades. With US help, dictator Manuel NORIEGA was deposed in 1989. The entire Panama Canal, the area supporting the Canal, and remaining US military bases were transferred to Panama by the end of 1999. In October 2006, Panamanians approved an ambitious plan (estimated to cost $5.3 billion) to expand the Canal. The project, which began in 2007 and could double the Canal's capacity, is expected to be completed in 2014-15.","geo":{"Location":"Central America, bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Pacific Ocean, between Colombia and Costa Rica","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":9,"min":0},"W":{"deg":80,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":75420,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":74340,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":1080,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than South Carolina","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":555,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Colombia 225 km, Costa Rica 330 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2490,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":"200 nm or edge of continental margin"},"Terrain":"interior mostly steep, rugged mountains and dissected, upland plains;

Services include operating the Panama Canal, logistics, banking, the Colon Free Zone, insurance, container ports, flagship registry, and tourism. Economic growth will be bolstered by the Panama Canal expansion project that began in 2007 and is scheduled to be completed by 2014 at a cost of $5.3 billion - about 25% of current GDP. The expansion project will more than double the Canal's capacity, enabling it to accommodate ships that are too large to traverse the existing canal. The United States and China are the top users of the Canal. Panama also plans to construct a metro system in Panama City, valued at $1.2 billion and scheduled to be completed by 2014. Panama's booming transportation and logistics services sectors, along with aggressive infrastructure development projects, will likely lead the economy to continued growth in 2011. Strong economic performance has not translated into broadly shared prosperity, as Panama has the second worst income distribution in Latin America. About 30% of the population lives in poverty; however, from 2006 to 2010 poverty was reduced by 10 percentage points, while unemployment dropped from 12% to 6% of the labor force. Panama and the United States signed a Trade Promotion Agreement in June 2007, which, when implemented, will help promote the country's economic growth. Seeking removal from the Organization of Economic Development's gray-list of tax havens, Panama has also recently signed various double taxation treaties with other nations.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":44360000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":26780000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":16.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":77.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":1557000,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":17.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":8.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":73.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":25.6,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":0.8,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":41.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":51,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":26.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":6944000000},"expenditures":{"usd":7051000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":40,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8.302,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":5040000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":24170000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":23200000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":8048000000},"Industrial production growth rate":"-1% (September 2010, year-over-year)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":6546000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":5805000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":124900000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":8740000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":93000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":4803,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":87100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.523 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"Exports":{"usd":12520000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Imports":{"Imports":{"usd":16050000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3525000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":13850000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":{"Exchange rates":"balboas (PAB) per US dollar -"},"industries":["construction, brewing, cement and other construction materials, sugar milling"],"agricultureProducts":["bananas","rice","corn","coffee","sugarcane","vegetables","livestock","shrimp"],"exportCommodities":["bananas","shrimp","sugar","coffee","clothing"],"exportPartners":["Greece 21.03%","US 17.63%","Japan 9.87%","Germany 4.28%","Italy 4.27%"],"importCommodities":["capital goods","foodstuffs","consumer goods","chemicals"],"importPartners":["Japan 36.21%","Singapore 16.86%","US 12.3%","China 7.84%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":537100,"Telephones - mobile cellular":5677000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"domestic and international facilities well developed","domestic":"mobile-cellular telephone subscribership has increased rapidly","international":"country code - 507;
