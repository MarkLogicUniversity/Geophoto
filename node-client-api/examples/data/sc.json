overview":"The economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis is heavily dependent upon tourism revenues, which has replaced sugar, the traditional mainstay of the economy until the 1970s. Following the 2005 harvest, the government closed the sugar industry after decades of losses of 3-4% of GDP annually. To compensate for employment losses, the government has embarked on a program to diversify the agricultural sector and to stimulate other sectors of the economy, such as tourism, export-oriented manufacturing, and offshore banking. More than 200,000 tourists visited the islands in 2009. Like other tourist destinations in the Caribbean, St. Kitts and Nevis is vulnerable to damage from natural disasters and shifts in tourism demand. The current government is constrained by one of the world's highest public debt burdens equivalent to roughly 185% of GDP, largely attributable to public enterprise losses.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":684000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":531000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-1.5% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":25.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":70.7,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":18170,"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":212400000},"expenditures":{"usd":232100000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":185,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8.75,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":94450000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":823800000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":790800000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":648000000},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":130000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":120900000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1225,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-163 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":84000000},"Imports":{"usd":383000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":314000000},"Exchange rates":"East Caribbean dollars (XCD) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, cotton, salt, copra, clothing, footwear, beverages"],"agricultureProducts":["sugarcane","rice","yams","vegetables","bananas","fish"],"exportCommodities":["machinery","food","electronics","beverages","tobacco"],"exportPartners":["US 62.3%","Canada 7.93%","Azerbaijan 6.72%"],"importCommodities":["machinery","manufactures","food","fuels"],"importPartners":["US 43.37%","Trinidad and Tobago 15.26%","Italy 11.83%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":20500,"Telephones - mobile cellular":83000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"good interisland and international connections","domestic":"interisland links via Eastern Caribbean Fiber Optic cable;
