{"code":"lg","name":"Latvia","region":"Europe","background":"The name \"Latvia\" originates from the ancient Latgalians, one of four eastern Baltic tribes that formed the ethnic core of the Latvian people (ca. 8th-12th centuries A.D.). The region subsequently came under the control of Germans, Poles, Swedes, and finally, Russians. A Latvian republic emerged following World War I, but it was annexed by the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US and many other countries. Latvia reestablished its independence in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union. Although the last Russian troops left in 1994, the status of the Russian minority (some 30% of the population) remains of concern to Moscow. Latvia joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea, between Estonia and Lithuania","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":57,"min":0},"E":{"deg":25,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":64589,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":62249,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":2340,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

Due to its geographical location, transit services are highly-developed, along with timber and wood-processing, agriculture and food products, and manufacturing of machinery and electronic devices. The bulk of the country's economic activity, however, is in the services sector. Corruption continues to be an impediment to attracting FDI flows and Latvia's low birth rate and decreasing population are major challenges to its long-term economic vitality. Latvia's economy experienced GDP growth of more than 10% per year during 2006-07, but entered a severe recession in 2008 as a result of an unsustainable current account deficit and large debt exposure amid the softening world economy. GDP plunged 18% in 2009 - the three Baltic states had the world's worst declines that year. Thanks to strong export growth in 2009 and 2010, the economy experienced its first real quarterly GDP growth in over two years (2.9%) in the third quarter of 2010. The IMF, EU, and other international donors provided substantial financial assistance to Latvia as part of an agreement to defend the currency's peg to the euro. This agreement calls for reduction of Latvia's fiscal deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2012, in order to meet the Maastricht Treaty criteria for euro adoption. DOMBROVSKIS' government enacted major spending cuts to reduce the fiscal deficit to a maximum of 8.5% of GDP in 2010, and Latvia has approved a 2011 budget with a projected deficit of 5.4% of GDP. The majority of companies, banks, and real estate have been privatized, although the state still holds sizable stakes in a few large enterprises. Latvia officially joined the World Trade Organization in February, 1999. EU membership, a top foreign policy goal, came in May 2004. Latvia's current major financial policy goal, entrance into the euro zone, is targeted for 2014.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":32509999999.999996},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":24050000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-0.3% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":75.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1178000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":12.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":25.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":61.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":14.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":27.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":36,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":15.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":8028000000},"expenditures":{"usd":9863000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":46.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"-1.2% (2010 est.)","Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":16.23,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":5769000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":11170000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":27590000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1824000000},"Industrial production growth rate":"-1.8% (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":4620000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":6822000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":2123000000.0000002,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":4643000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":40000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":5873,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":43400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":1527000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1743000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":1620000000},"Exports":{"usd":7894000000},"Imports":{"usd":9153000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":7170000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":37280000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":11710000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1097000000},"Exchange rates":"lati (LVL) per US dollar -","industries":["processed foods, processed wood products, textiles, processed metals, pharmaceuticals, railroad cars, synthetic fibers, electronics"],"agricultureProducts":["grain","rapeseed","potatoes","vegetables","pork","poultry","milk","eggs","fish"],"exportCommodities":["food products","wood and wood products","metals","machinery and equipment","textiles"],"exportPartners":["Lithuania 15.19%","Estonia 13.57%","Russia 13.17%","Germany 8.13%","Sweden 5.7%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","consumer goods","chemicals","fuels","vehicles"],"importPartners":["Lithuania 16.36%","Germany 11.34%","Russia 10.68%","Poland 8.11%","Estonia 7.69%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":644000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2243000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"recent efforts focused on bringing competition to the telecommunications sector;
