{"code":"hr","name":"Croatia","region":"Europe","background":"The lands that today comprise Croatia were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the close of World War I. In 1918, the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal independent Communist state under the strong hand of Marshal TITO. Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands. Under UN supervision, the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was returned to Croatia in 1998. In April 2009, Croatia joined NATO; it is a candidate for eventual EU accession.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea, between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovenia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":45,"min":10},"E":{"deg":15,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":56594,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":55974,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":620,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

Between 2000 and 2007, however, Croatia's economic fortunes began to improve slowly, with moderate but steady GDP growth between 4% and 6% led by a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending. Inflation over the same period has remained tame and the currency, the kuna, stable. Nevertheless, difficult problems still remain, including a stubbornly high unemployment rate, a growing trade deficit and uneven regional development. The state retains a large role in the economy, as privatization efforts often meet stiff public and political resistance. While macroeconomic stabilization has largely been achieved, structural reforms lag because of deep resistance on the part of the public and lack of strong support from politicians. The EU accession process should accelerate fiscal and structural reform. While long term growth prospects for the economy remain strong, Croatia will face significant pressure as a result of the global financial crisis. Croatia's high foreign debt, anemic export sector, strained state budget, and over-reliance on tourism revenue will result in higher risk to economic stability over the medium term.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":78090000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":60590000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-1.4% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":6.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":27.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":66,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1762000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":31.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":63.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":17.6,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":23.1,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":29,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":22000000000},"expenditures":{"usd":24290000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":55,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.55,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":8720000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":40800000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":48620000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":25640000000},"Industrial production growth rate":"-0.9% (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":11490000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":18000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":5668000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":12240000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":23960,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":106000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":43750,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":122100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":73350000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":2847000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":3205000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":695500000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1220000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":30580000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.312 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":11510000000},"Imports":{"usd":20930000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":13790000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":59700000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":34630000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":6334000000},"Exchange rates":"kuna (HRK) per US dollar -","industries":["chemicals and plastics, machine tools, fabricated metal, electronics, pig iron and rolled steel products, aluminum, paper, wood products, construction materials, textiles, shipbuilding, petroleum and petroleum refining, food and beverages, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","corn","sugar beets","sunflower seed","barley","alfalfa","clover","olives","citrus","grapes","soybeans","potatoes","livestock","dairy products"],"exportCommodities":["transport equipment","machinery","textiles","chemicals","foodstuffs","fuels"],"exportPartners":["Italy 19.1%","Bosnia and Herzegovina 12.98%","Germany 11.06%","Slovenia 7.47%","Austria 5.44%","Serbia 5.41%"],"importCommodities":["machinery","transport and electrical equipment","chemicals","fuels and lubricants","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["Italy 15.46%","Germany 13.57%","Russia 9.29%","China 6.83%","Slovenia 5.75%","Austria 5.04%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1859000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":6035000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"the telecommunications network has improved steadily since the mid-1990s;
