{"code":"pe","name":"Peru","region":"South America","background":"Ancient Peru was the seat of several prominent Andean civilizations, most notably that of the Incas whose empire was captured by the Spanish conquistadors in 1533. Peruvian independence was declared in 1821, and remaining Spanish forces were defeated in 1824. After a dozen years of military rule, Peru returned to democratic leadership in 1980, but experienced economic problems and the growth of a violent insurgency. President Alberto FUJIMORI's election in 1990 ushered in a decade that saw a dramatic turnaround in the economy and significant progress in curtailing guerrilla activity. Nevertheless, the president's increasing reliance on authoritarian measures and an economic slump in the late 1990s generated mounting dissatisfaction with his regime, which led to his ouster in 2000. A caretaker government oversaw new elections in the spring of 2001, which ushered in Alejandro TOLEDO Manrique as the new head of government - Peru's first democratically elected president of Native American ethnicity. The presidential election of 2006 saw the return of Alan GARCIA Perez who, after a disappointing presidential term from 1985 to 1990, has overseen a robust macroeconomic performance.","geo":{"Location":"Western South America, bordering the South Pacific Ocean, between Chile and Ecuador","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":10,"min":0},"W":{"deg":76,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":1285,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":1279,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":5220,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Alaska","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":7461,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Bolivia 1,075 km, Brazil 2,995 km, Chile 171 km, Colombia 1,800 km, Ecuador 1,420 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2414,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"western coastal plain (costa), high and rugged Andes in center (sierra), eastern lowland jungle of Amazon Basin (selva)","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Nevado Huascaran 6,768 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":2.88,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.47,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":96.65,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":11950,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":1913,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":20.13,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":720,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, landslides, mild volcanic activity","volcanism":"Peru experiences volcanic activity in the Andes Mountains;

Abundant mineral resources are found in the mountainous areas, and Peru's coastal waters provide excellent fishing grounds. The Peruvian economy grew by almost 6% per year during the period 2002-06, with a stable exchange rate and low inflation. Growth jumped to nearly 9% per year in 2007 and 10% in 2008, driven by private investment and government spending, but then fell to less than 1% in 2009 in the face of the world recession, a sharp fall of private investment, and a substantial increase in counter-cyclical government spending. Growth resumed in 2010 at above 8%, due partly to a leap in private investment and continued high government spending. Peru's rapid expansion coupled with the government's conditional cash transfers and other programs have helped to reduce the national poverty rate by over 19 percentage points since 2002, though underemployment remains high. Inflation in 2010 was within the Central Bank's 1%-3% target range. Despite Peru's strong macroeconomic performance, dependence on minerals and metals exports and imported foodstuffs subjects the economy to fluctuations in world prices. Poor infrastructure hinders the spread of growth to Peru's non-coastal areas. A growing number of Peruvians are sharing in the benefits of growth but despite President GARCIA's pursuit of sound trade and macroeconomic policies, inequality persists. Nevertheless, he remains committed to Peru's free-trade path. Since 2006, Peru has signed trade deals with the United States, Canada, Singapore, China, Korea, and Japan, concluded negotiations with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and Chile, and begun trade talks with Central American countries and others. The US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) entered into force 1 February 2009, opening the way to greater trade and investment between the two economies. Rising world prices of foodstuffs and fuel, coupled with strong domestic demand, are immediate concerns for 2011. Peru has continued to attract foreign investment. However, political disputes may impede development of some projects related to natural resource extraction.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":275700000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":152800000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":8.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":35,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":55,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":15680000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":23.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":75.5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.9,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":34.8,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":37.9,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":49.6,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":25.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":30530000000},"expenditures":{"usd":29720000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":23.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":3.63,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":15260000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":55200000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":44200000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":160900000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":35790000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":31740000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":111900000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":157200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":150700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":68640,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":88080,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1163000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":7240000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":3650000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":3590000000,"unit":"cu m"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":453000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.315 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":35560000000},"Imports":{"usd":25740000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":44110000000},"Debt - external":{"Debt - external":{"usd":33290000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":43470000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":2120000000},"Exchange rates":"nuevo sol (PEN) per US dollar -","industries":["mining and refining of minerals","steel, metal fabrication","petroleum extraction and refining, natural gas and natural gas liquefaction","fishing and fish processing, cement, textiles, clothing, food processing"],"agricultureProducts":["asparagus","coffee","cocoa","cotton","sugarcane","rice","potatoes","corn","plantains","grapes","oranges","pineapples","guavas","bananas","apples","lemons","pears","coca","tomatoes","mango","barley","medicinal plants","palm oil","marigold","onion","wheat","dry beans","poultry","beef","dairy products","fish","guinea pigs"],"exportCommodities":["copper","gold","zinc","tin","iron ore","molybdenum","crude petroleum and petroleum products","natural gas","coffee","potatoes","asparagus and other vegetables","fruit","apparel and textiles","fishmeal"],"exportPartners":["US 16.98%","China 15.3%","Switzerland 14.85%","Canada 8.67%","Japan 5.14% (2010 est.)"],"importCommodities":["petroleum and petroleum products","chemicals","plastics","machinery","vehicles","color TV sets","power shovels","front-end loaders","telephones and telecommunication equipment","iron and steel","wheat","corn","soybean products","paper","cotton","vaccines and medicines"],"importPartners":["US 19.72%","China 15%","Brazil 7.77%","Ecuador 4.9%","Chile 4.6%","Colombia 4.4%","Japan 4.1% (2010 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":2965000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":24700000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"adequate for most requirements;
