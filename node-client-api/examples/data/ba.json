{"code":"ba","name":"Bahrain","region":"Middle East","background":"In 1783, the Sunni Al-Khalifa family captured Bahrain from the Persians. In order to secure these holdings, it entered into a series of treaties with the UK during the 19th century that made Bahrain a British protectorate. The archipelago attained its independence in 1971. Facing declining oil reserves, Bahrain has turned to petroleum processing and refining and has transformed itself into an international banking center. Bahrain's small size and central location among Persian Gulf countries require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign affairs among its larger neighbors. In addition, the Sunni-led government has struggled to manage relations with its approximately 70% Shia-majority population. During the mid-to-late 1990s Shia activists mounted a low-intensity uprising to demand that the Sunni-led government stop systemic economic, social, and political discrimination against Shia Bahrainis. King HAMAD bin Isa Al-Khalifa, after succeeding his late father in 1999, pushed economic and political reforms in part to improve relations with the Shia community. After boycotting the country's first round of democratic elections under the newly-promulgated constitution in 2002, Shia political societies participated in 2006 and 2010 in legislative and municipal elections and Wafiq, the largest Shia political society, won the largest bloc of seats in the elected lower-house of the legislature both times. Nevertheless, Shia discontent has persisted, often manifesting itself in street demonstrations and occasional low-level violence. \r\n","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, archipelago in the Persian Gulf, east of Saudi Arabia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":26,"min":0},"E":{"deg":50,"min":33}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":760,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":760,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"3.5 times the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":161,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"extending to boundaries to be determined"},"Terrain":"mostly low desert plain rising gently to low central escarpment","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Persian Gulf 0 m","highest point":"Jabal ad Dukhan 122 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":2.82,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":5.63,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":91.55,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":40,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":0.3,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":411,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"periodic droughts;

Highly developed communication and transport facilities make Bahrain home to numerous multinational firms with business in the Gulf. As part of its diversification plans, Bahrain implemented a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US in August 2006, the first FTA between the US and a Gulf state. Bahrain's economy, however, continues to depend heavily on oil. Petroleum production and refining account for more than 60% of Bahrain's export receipts, 70% of government revenues, and 11% of GDP (exclusive of allied industries). Other major economic activities are production of aluminum - Bahrain's second biggest export after oil - finance, and construction. Bahrain competes with Malaysia as a worldwide center for Islamic banking and continues to seek new natural gas supplies as feedstock to support its expanding petrochemical and aluminum industries. Unemployment, especially among the young, is a long-term economic problem Bahrain struggles to address. In 2009, to help lower unemployment among Bahraini nationals, Bahrain reduced sponsorship for expatriate workers, increasing the costs of employing foreign labor. The global financial crisis caused funding for many non-oil projects to dry up and resulted in slower economic growth for Bahrain. Other challenges facing Bahrain include the slow growth of government debt as a result of a large subsidy program, the financing of large government projects, and debt restructuring, such as the bailout of state-owned Gulf Air.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":29710000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":22660000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":56.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":42.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":611000,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":79,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":26.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":5933000000},"expenditures":{"usd":5948000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":59.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA% (31 December 2009 est.)","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":6372000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":21020000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":18460000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":16930000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":10250000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":10100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":48560,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":39000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":238300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":228400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":124600000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":12640000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":12640000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":92030000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":589000000},"Exports":{"usd":15130000000},"Imports":{"usd":12140000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3766000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":14680000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":15770000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":8398999999.999999},"Exchange rates":"Bahraini dinars (BHD) per US dollar -","industries":["petroleum processing and refining, aluminum smelting, iron pelletization, fertilizers, Islamic and offshore banking, insurance, ship repairing, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["fruit","vegetables","poultry","dairy products","shrimp","fish"],"exportCommodities":["petroleum and petroleum products","aluminum","textiles"],"exportPartners":["India 4.2%","Saudi Arabia 2.78%"],"importCommodities":["crude oil","machinery","chemicals"],"importPartners":["Saudi Arabia 22.91%","France 9.76%","US 7.95%","China 6.4%","South Korea 5.26%","Japan 5.19%","Germany 5.01%","UK 4.34%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":238400,"Telephones - mobile cellular":1578000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern system","domestic":"modern fiber-optic integrated services;
