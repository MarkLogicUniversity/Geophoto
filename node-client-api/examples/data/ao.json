{"code":"ao","name":"Angola","region":"Africa","background":"Angola is rebuilding its country after the end of a 27-year civil war in 2002. Fighting between the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), led by Jose Eduardo DOS SANTOS, and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas SAVIMBI, followed independence from Portugal in 1975. Peace seemed imminent in 1992 when Angola held national elections, but fighting picked up again by 1996. Up to 1.5 million lives may have been lost - and 4 million people displaced - in the quarter century of fighting. SAVIMBI's death in 2002 ended UNITA's insurgency and strengthened the MPLA's hold on power. President DOS SANTOS held legislative elections in September 2008 and, despite promising to hold presidential elections in 2009, has since pushed through a new constitution that calls for elections in 2012.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Africa, bordering the South Atlantic Ocean, between Namibia and Democratic Republic of the Congo","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":12,"min":30},"E":{"deg":18,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":1246,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":1246,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than twice the size of Texas","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":5198,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Democratic Republic of the Congo 2,511 km (of which 225 km is the boundary of discontiguous Cabinda Province), Republic of the Congo 201 km, Namibia 1,376 km, Zambia 1,110 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1600,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"narrow coastal plain rises abruptly to vast interior plateau","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Morro de Moco 2,620 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":2.65,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.23,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":97.12,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":800,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":184,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":0.35,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":22,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"locally heavy rainfall causes periodic flooding on the plateau","internationalEnvironmentAgreements":{"signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements","partyTo":["Biodiversity","Climate Change","Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol","Desertification","Law of the Sea","Marine Dumping","Ozone Layer Protection","Ship Pollution"]},"naturalResources":["petroleum","diamonds","iron ore","phosphates","copper","feldspar","gold","bauxite","uranium"],"environmentalIssues":["overuse of pastures and subsequent soil erosion attributable to population pressures","desertification","deforestation of tropical rain forest, in response to both international demand for tropical timber and to domestic use as fuel, resulting in loss of biodiversity","soil erosion contributing to water pollution and siltation of rivers and dams","inadequate supplies of potable water"],"climate":["semiarid in south and along coast to Luanda","north has cool, dry season (May to October) and hot, rainy season (November to April)"],"geographyNote":["the province of Cabinda is an exclave, separated from the rest of the country by the Democratic Republic of the Congo"]},"people":{"Population":13338,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":43.2,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":54.1,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"2.7% (male 157,778/female 199,959) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":18.1,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":18.1,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":18.1,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":2.034,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":42.91,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":23.4,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":{"quantity":0.82,"unit":"migrant(s)/1,000 population"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":59,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":4,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Major cities - population":"LUANDA (capital) 4.511 million;

Angola became a member of OPEC in late 2006 and in late 2007 was assigned a production quota of 1.9 million barrels a day (bbl/day), somewhat less than the 2-2.5 million bbl/day Angola's government had wanted. Oil production and its supporting activities contribute about 85% of GDP. Diamond exports contribute an additional 5%. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for most of the people, but half of the country's food is still imported. Increased oil production supported growth averaging more than 15% per year from 2004 to 2008. A postwar reconstruction boom and resettlement of displaced persons has led to high rates of growth in construction and agriculture as well. Much of the country's infrastructure is still damaged or undeveloped from the 27-year-long civil war. Land mines left from the war still mar the countryside, even though peace was established after the death of rebel leader Jonas SAVIMBI in February 2002. Since 2005, the government has used billions of dollars in credit lines from China, Brazil, Portugal, Germany, Spain, and the EU to rebuild Angola's public infrastructure. The global recession temporarily stalled economic growth. Lower prices for oil and diamonds during the global recession led to a contraction in GDP in 2009, and many construction projects stopped because Luanda accrued $9 billion in arrears to foreign construction companies when government revenue fell in 2008 and 2009. Angola abandoned its currency peg in 2009, and in November 2009 signed onto an IMF Stand-By Arrangement loan of $1.4 billion to rebuild international reserves. Although consumer inflation declined from 325% in 2000 to under 14% in 2010, Luanda has been unable to reduce inflation below 10%. The Angolan kwanza depreciated again in mid 2010, which, along with higher oil prices, should boost economic growth in all sectors. Corruption, especially in the extractive sectors, also is a major challenge.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":107300000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":85310000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":9.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":65.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":24.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":7977000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":85,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":40.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":0.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":44.7,"unit":"%"}},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":15.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":40410000000},"expenditures":{"usd":37380000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":20.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":13.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":15.68,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":8740000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":24920000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":17520000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":3722000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":3173000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":1948000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":70000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1407000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":28090,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":13500000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":680000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":680000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":271800000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":2089000000},"Exports":{"usd":51650000000},"Imports":{"usd":18100000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":16890000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":17980000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":91550000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":4883000000},"Exchange rates":"kwanza (AOA) per US dollar -","industries":["petroleum","diamonds, iron ore, phosphates, feldspar, bauxite, uranium, and gold","cement","basic metal products","fish processing","food processing, brewing, tobacco products, sugar","textiles","ship repair"],"agricultureProducts":["bananas","sugarcane","coffee","sisal","corn","cotton","manioc (tapioca)","tobacco","vegetables","plantains","livestock","forest products","fish"],"exportCommodities":["crude oil","diamonds","refined petroleum products","coffee","sisal","fish and fish products","timber","cotton"],"exportPartners":["China 35.65%","US 25.98%","France 8.83%","South Africa 4.13%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and electrical equipment","vehicles and spare parts","medicines","food","textiles","military goods"],"importPartners":["Portugal 18.71%","China 17.39%","US 8.51%","Brazil 8.22%","South Korea 6.72%","France 4.51%","Italy 4.28%","South Africa 4.02%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":303200,"Telephones - mobile cellular":8109000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"limited system;
