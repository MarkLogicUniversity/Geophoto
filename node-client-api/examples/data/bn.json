{"code":"bn","name":"Benin","region":"Africa","background":"Present day Benin was the site of Dahomey, a prominent West African kingdom that rose in the 15th century. The territory became a French Colony in 1872 and achieved independence on 1 August 1960, as the Republic of Benin. A succession of military governments ended in 1972 with the rise to power of Mathieu KEREKOU and the establishment of a government based on Marxist-Leninist principles. A move to representative government began in 1989. Two years later, free elections ushered in former Prime Minister Nicephore SOGLO as president, marking the first successful transfer of power in Africa from a dictatorship to a democracy. KEREKOU was returned to power by elections held in 1996 and 2001, though some irregularities were alleged. KEREKOU stepped down at the end of his second term in 2006 and was succeeded by Thomas YAYI Boni, a political outsider and independent. YAYI has attempted to stem corruption and has strongly promoted accelerating Benin's economic growth.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the Bight of Benin, between Nigeria and Togo","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":9,"min":30},"E":{"deg":2,"min":15}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":112622,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":110622,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":2000,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Pennsylvania","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1989,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Burkina Faso 306 km, Niger 266 km, Nigeria 773 km, Togo 644 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":121,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"mostly flat to undulating plain;

Growth in real output had averaged about 4% before the global recession, but fell to 2.7% in 2009 and 3% in 2010. Inflation has subsided over the past several years. In order to raise growth, Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis on tourism, facilitate the development of new food processing systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and communication technology. Specific projects to improve the business climate by reforms to the land tenure system, the commercial justice system, and the financial sector were included in Benin's $307 million Millennium Challenge Account grant signed in February 2006. The 2001 privatization policy continues in telecommunications, water, electricity, and agriculture. As result of these reforms, Benin has become the most competitive country in the West African Economic and Monetary Union, according to the World Economic Forum. The Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt situation, with Benin benefiting from a G-8 debt reduction announced in July 2005, while pressing for more rapid structural reforms. An insufficient electrical supply continues to adversely affect Benin's economic growth though the government recently has taken steps to increase domestic power production.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":13990000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":6649000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":33.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":14.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":52.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3662000,"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":37.4,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":29,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":36.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1348000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1731000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1551000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2424000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1222000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":124000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":597000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":588000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":23000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":8770,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":28900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":8000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1133000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-582 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1125000000},"Imports":{"usd":1812000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1254000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2894000000},"Exchange rates":"Communaute Financiere Africaine francs (XOF) per US dollar -","industries":["textiles, food processing, construction materials, cement"],"agricultureProducts":["cotton","corn","cassava (tapioca)","yams","beans","palm oil","peanuts","cashews","livestock"],"exportCommodities":["cotton","cashews","shea butter","textiles","palm products","seafood"],"exportPartners":["India 19.72%","China 13.18%","Niger 6.94%","Nigeria 6.56%","Indonesia 5.73%","Togo 5.63%","Namibia 4.17%"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","capital goods","petroleum products"],"importPartners":["China 35.62%","US 7.51%","France 7.38%","Thailand 6.71%","Malaysia 6.13%","Netherlands 4.83%","Belgium 4.02%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":127100,"Telephones - mobile cellular":5033000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"inadequate system of open-wire, microwave radio relay, and cellular connections;
