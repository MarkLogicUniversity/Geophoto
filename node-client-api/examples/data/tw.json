Following the Communist victory on the mainland in 1949, 2 million Nationalists fled to Taiwan and established a government using the 1947 constitution drawn up for all of China. Over the next five decades, the ruling authorities gradually democratized and incorporated the local population within the governing structure. In 2000, Taiwan underwent its first peaceful transfer of power from the Nationalist to the Democratic Progressive Party. Throughout this period, the island prospered and became one of East Asia's economic \"Tigers.\" The dominant political issues continue to be the relationship between Taiwan and China - specifically the question of Taiwan's eventual status - as well as domestic political and economic reform.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Asia, islands bordering the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, South China Sea, and Taiwan Strait, north of the Philippines, off the southeastern coast of China","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":23,"min":30},"E":{"deg":121,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":35980,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":32260,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":3720,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Maryland and Delaware combined","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1566.3,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"eastern two-thirds mostly rugged mountains;

In keeping with this trend, some large, state-owned banks and industrial firms have been privatized. Exports, led by electronics and machinery, generate about 70% of Taiwan's GDP growth, and have provided the primary impetus for economic development. This heavy dependence on exports exposes the economy to upturns and downturns in world demand. In 2009, Taiwan's GDP contracted 1.9%, due primarily to a 20% year-on-year decline in exports. In 2010 GDP grew 10.5%, as exports returned to the level of previous years. Taiwan's diplomatic isolation, low birth rate, and rapidly aging population are major long-term challenges. Free trade agreements have proliferated in East Asia over the past several years, but so far Taiwan has been excluded from this greater economic integration, largely because of its diplomatic status. Taiwan's Total Fertility rate of just over one child per woman is among the lowest in the world, raising the prospect of future labor shortages, falling domestic demand, and declining tax revenues. Taiwan's population is aging quickly, with the number of people over 65 accounting for 10.9% of the island's total population as 2011. The island runs a large trade surplus, and its foreign reserves are the world's fourth largest, behind China, Japan, and Russia. Since President MA Ying-jeou took office in May 2008, cross-Strait economic ties have increased significantly. Since 2005 China has overtaken the US to become Taiwan's second-largest source of imports after Japan. China is also the island's number one destination for foreign direct investment. Taiwan has focused much of its efforts on improving the cross-Strait economic relationship. Three financial memorandums of understanding, covering banking, securities, and insurance, took effect in mid-January 2010, opening the island to greater investments from the mainland's financial firms and institutional investors, and providing new opportunities for Taiwan financial firms to operate in China. Taiwan and the mainland in June 2010 signed the landmark Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), an agreement that the Taiwan authorities hope will eventually lead to a free-trade arrangement that will increase cross-Strait economic ties by lowering tariffs on a number of goods and by reducing market access barriers for services. The Taiwan authorities have said that the ECFA will serve as a stepping stone toward trade pacts with other regional partners and they announced that formal negotiations towards an economic cooperation agreement with Singapore would begin in 2011. Closer economic links with the mainland brings greater opportunities for the Taiwan economy, but also poses new challenges. For example, FDI in China has resulted in Chinese import substitution away from Taiwan's exports and a restriction of potential job creation in Taiwan.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":821800000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":430600000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":10.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":31.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":67.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":11070000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":35.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":58.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":1.16,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":6.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":40.3,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":32.6,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":72240000000},"expenditures":{"usd":79650000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":33.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.625,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":2.68,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":377300000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1022000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":751500000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":784100000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":26.4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":229100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":220800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":276800,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":834000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":303000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":876300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":2800000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":350700000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":11630000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":11590000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":6229000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":39000000000},"Exports":{"usd":274600000000.00003},"Imports":{"usd":251400000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":387200000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":91410000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":111100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":162900000000},"Exchange rates":"New Taiwan dollars (TWD) per US dollar -","industries":["electronics, communications and information technology products, petroleum refining, armaments, chemicals, textiles, iron and steel, machinery, cement, food processing, vehicles, consumer products, pharmaceuticals"],"agricultureProducts":["rice","vegetables","fruit","tea","flowers","pigs","poultry","fish"],"exportCommodities":["electronics","flat panels","machinery","metals","textiles","plastics","chemicals","optical","photographic","measuring","and medical instruments"],"exportPartners":["China 28.1%","Hong Kong 13.8%","US 11.5%","Japan 6.6%","Singapore 4.4% (2010 est.)"],"importCommodities":["electronics","machinery","crude petroleum","precision instruments","organic chemicals","metals"],"importPartners":["Japan 20.7%","China 14.2%","US 10%","South Korea 6.4%","Saudi Arabia 4.7% (2010 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":14596000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":26959000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"provides telecommunications service for every business and private need","domestic":"thoroughly modern;
