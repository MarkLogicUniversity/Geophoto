{"code":"bp","name":"Solomon Islands","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"The UK established a protectorate over the Solomon Islands in the 1890s. Some of the most bitter fighting of World War II occurred on this archipelago. Self-government was achieved in 1976 and independence two years later. Ethnic violence, government malfeasance, and endemic crime have undermined stability and civil society. In June 2003, then Prime Minister Sir Allan KEMAKEZA sought the assistance of Australia in reestablishing law and order; the following month, an Australian-led multinational force arrived to restore peace and disarm ethnic militias. The Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) has generally been effective in restoring law and order and rebuilding government institutions.","geo":{"Location":"Oceania, group of islands in the South Pacific Ocean, east of Papua New Guinea","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":8,"min":0},"E":{"deg":159,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":28896,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":27986,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":910,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Maryland","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":5313,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"Maritime claims":"measured from claimed archipelagic baselines","territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"mostly rugged mountains with some low coral atolls","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Mount Popomanaseu 2,310 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0.62,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":2.04,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":97.34,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":"NA","Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":44.7,"unit":"cu km"},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"typhoons, but rarely destructive;
