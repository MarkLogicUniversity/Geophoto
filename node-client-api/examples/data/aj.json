{"code":"aj","name":"Azerbaijan","region":"Middle East","background":"Azerbaijan - a nation with a majority-Turkic and majority-Muslim population - was briefly independent from 1918 to 1920; it regained its independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Despite a 1994 cease-fire, Azerbaijan has yet to resolve its conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated region that Moscow recognized as part of Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s after Armenia and Azerbaijan disputed the status of the territory. Armenia and Azerbaijan began fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after both countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May 1994, when a cease-fire took hold, ethnic Armenian forces held not only Nagorno-Karabakh but also seven surrounding provinces in the territory of Azerbaijan. Corruption in the country is ubiquitous, and the government, which eliminated presidential term limits in a 2009 referendum, has been accused of authoritarianism. Although the poverty rate has been reduced in recent years due to revenue from oil production, the promise of widespread wealth resulting from the continued development of Azerbaijan's energy sector remains largely unfulfilled.","geo":{"Location":"Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran and Russia, with a small European portion north of the Caucasus range","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":40,"min":30},"E":{"deg":47,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":86600,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":82629,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":3971,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Maine","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":2013,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Armenia (with Azerbaijan-proper) 566 km, Armenia (with Azerbaijan-Naxcivan exclave) 221 km, Georgia 322 km, Iran (with Azerbaijan-proper) 432 km, Iran (with Azerbaijan-Naxcivan exclave) 179 km, Russia 284 km, Turkey 9 km"},"Coastline":"0 km (landlocked);

In 2009, economic growth remained above 9% even as oil prices moderated and growth in the construction sector cooled. In 2010, economic growth slowed to 3.7%, although the impact of the global financial crisis was less severe than in many other countries in the region. The current global economic slowdown presents some challenges for the Azerbaijani economy as oil prices remain below their mid-2008 highs, highlighting Azerbaijan's reliance on energy exports and lackluster attempts to diversify its economy. Azerbaijan's oil production increased dramatically in 1997, when Azerbaijan signed the first production-sharing arrangement (PSA) with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company. Oil exports through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline remain the main economic driver while efforts to boost Azerbaijan's gas production are underway. However, Azerbaijan has made only limited progress on instituting market-based economic reforms. Pervasive public and private sector corruption and structural economic inefficiencies remain a drag on long-term growth, particularly in non-energy sectors. Several other obstacles impede Azerbaijan's economic progress: the need for stepped up foreign investment in the non-energy sector and the continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance, while trade is building with Turkey and the nations of Europe. Long-term prospects will depend on world oil prices, the location of new oil and gas pipelines in the region, and Azerbaijan's ability to manage its energy wealth to promote sustainable growth in non-energy sectors of the economy and spur employment.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":90790000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":54370000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":61.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":33.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5874000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":38.3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":12.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":49.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":6.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":17.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":36.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":17.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":14190000000},"expenditures":{"usd":14640000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":4.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":20.03,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":7340000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":11640000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":8135000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":18600000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":18000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":786000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":548000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":1010999.9999999999,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":136000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":528900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2848,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":7000000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":23000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":10120000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":5564000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":849500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":15960000000},"Exports":{"usd":28070000000},"Imports":{"usd":7035000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":6330000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":3221000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":8918000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":6058000000},"Exchange rates":"Azerbaijani manats (AZN) per US dollar -","industries":["petroleum and natural gas, petroleum products, oilfield equipment","steel, iron ore","cement","chemicals and petrochemicals","textiles"],"agricultureProducts":["cotton","grain","rice","grapes","fruit","vegetables","tea","tobacco","cattle","pigs","sheep","goats"],"exportCommodities":["oil and gas 90%","machinery","cotton","foodstuffs"],"exportPartners":["Italy 20.69%","India 10.67%","US 9.24%","France 8.15%","Germany 7.62%","Indonesia 6.63%","Canada 5.13%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","oil products","foodstuffs","metals","chemicals"],"importPartners":["Turkey 18.69%","Russia 16.98%","Germany 7.87%","Ukraine 7.3%","China 6.18%","UK 5.73%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1397000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":7757000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"requires considerable expansion and modernization;
