Growth has been led by the tourist sector, which employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70% of hard currency earnings, and by tuna fishing. In recent years, the government has encouraged foreign investment to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale manufacturing. GDP grew about 7-8% per year in 2006-07, driven by tourism and a boom in tourism-related construction. The Seychelles rupee was allowed to depreciate in 2006 after being overvalued for years and fell by 10% in the first 9 months of 2007. Despite these actions, the Seychelles economy has struggled to maintain its gains and in 2008 suffered from food and oil price shocks, a foreign exchange shortage, high inflation, large financing gaps, and the global recession. In July 2008 the government defaulted on a Euro amortizing note worth roughly US$80 million, leading to a downgrading of Seychelles credit rating, but in October 2010 the EU approved a $2.9 million grant as part of a larger four-year program for Seychelles. In response to Seychelles successful implementation of tighter monetary and fiscal policies, the IMF upgraded Seychelles to a three-year extended fund facility (EFF) of $31 million in December 2009. In 2008, GDP fell more than 1% due to declining tourism, but the economy recovered in 2009-10 with a notable increase in tourist numbers for 2010.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":2053000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":936000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":30.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":66.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":39560,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":74,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":36.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":316500000},"expenditures":{"usd":310300000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":58.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"-2.2% (2010 est.)","Central bank discount rate":"NA% (31 December 2009)","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":15.35,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":274200000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":415000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":678500000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":250000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":232500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":7000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":7653,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-351 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":464000000},"Imports":{"usd":831000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":193000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1374000000},"Exchange rates":"Seychelles rupees (SCR) per US dollar -","industries":["fishing, tourism, processing of coconuts and vanilla, coir (coconut fiber) rope, boat building, printing, furniture","beverages"],"agricultureProducts":["coconuts","cinnamon","vanilla","sweet potatoes","cassava (tapioca)","copra","bananas","poultry","tuna"],"exportCommodities":["canned tuna","frozen fish","cinnamon bark","copra","petroleum products (reexports)"],"exportPartners":["UK 24.84%","France 18.53%","Italy 9.45%","Mauritius 9.03%","Japan 6.98%","Spain 4.92%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","foodstuffs","petroleum products","chemicals","other manufactured goods"],"importPartners":["Saudi Arabia 16.44%","India 8.33%","Spain 7.49%","South Africa 6.72%","France 6.39%","Brazil 6.07%","Singapore 5.07%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":22100,"Telephones - mobile cellular":92300,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"effective system","domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity is 130 telephones per 100 persons;
