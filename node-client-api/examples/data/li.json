{"code":"li","name":"Liberia","region":"Africa","background":"Settlement of freed slaves from the US in what is today Liberia began in 1822; by 1847, the Americo-Liberians were able to establish a republic. William TUBMAN, president from 1944-71, did much to promote foreign investment and to bridge the economic, social, and political gaps between the descendents of the original settlers and the inhabitants of the interior. In 1980, a military coup led by Samuel DOE ushered in a decade of authoritarian rule. In December 1989, Charles TAYLOR launched a rebellion against DOE's regime that led to a prolonged civil war in which DOE himself was killed. A period of relative peace in 1997 allowed for elections that brought TAYLOR to power, but major fighting resumed in 2000. An August 2003 peace agreement ended the war and prompted the resignation of former president Charles TAYLOR, who faces war crimes charges in The Hague related to his involvement in Sierra Leone's civil war. After two years of rule by a transitional government, democratic elections in late 2005 brought President Ellen JOHNSON SIRLEAF to power. The UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) maintains a strong presence throughout the country, but the security situation is still fragile and the process of rebuilding the social and economic structure of this war-torn country continues.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Cote d'Ivoire and Sierra Leone","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":6,"min":30},"W":{"deg":9,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":111369,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":96320,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":15049,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

Civil war and government mismanagement destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially the infrastructure in and around the capital, Monrovia. Many businesses fled the country, taking capital and expertise with them, but with the conclusion of fighting and the installation of a democratically-elected government in 2006, several have returned. Liberia has the distinction of having the highest ratio of direct foreign investment to GDP in the world. Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic products, primarily raw timber and rubber and is reviving those sectors. Local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope. President JOHNSON SIRLEAF, a Harvard-trained banker and administrator, has taken steps to reduce corruption, build support from international donors, and encourage private investment. Embargos on timber and diamond exports have been lifted, opening new sources of revenue for the government and Liberia shipped its first major timber exports to Europe in 2010. The country reached its Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative completion point in 2010 and nearly $5 billion of international debt was permanently eliminated. This new status will enable Liberia to establish a sovereign credit rating and issue bonds. Liberia's Paris Club creditors agreed to cancel Liberia's debt as well. Rebuilding infrastructure and raising incomes will depend on generous financial and technical assistance from donor countries and foreign investment in key sectors, such as infrastructure and power generation.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1691000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":974000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":76.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":5.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":17.7,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1372000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":85,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":30.1,"unit":"%"}},"Budget":{"revenues":"$NA","expenditures":"$NA"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":11.2,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":14.4,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":206900000},"Stock of broad money":"$NA","Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1202000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":350000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":325500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":4000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":23.37,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4263,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-224 million (2007)","Exports":{"usd":1197000000},"Imports":{"usd":7143000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":3200000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Liberian dollars (LRD) per US dollar -","industries":["rubber processing, palm oil processing, timber, diamonds"],"agricultureProducts":["rubber","coffee","cocoa","rice","cassava (tapioca)","palm oil","sugarcane","bananas","sheep","goats","timber"],"exportCommodities":["rubber","timber","iron","diamonds","cocoa","coffee"],"exportPartners":["Germany 27.92%","Poland 17.12%","South Africa 15.83%","India 10.48%","Greece 7.09%","US 6.23%","Norway 5.24%"],"importCommodities":["fuels","chemicals","machinery","transportation equipment","manufactured goods","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["South Korea 28.29%","Singapore 19.06%","Japan 17.06%","China 14.58%","Taiwan 4.02%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":2000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":842000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"the limited services available are found almost exclusively in the capital Monrovia;
