{"code":"td","name":"Trinidad and Tobago","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"First colonized by the Spanish, the islands came under British control in the early 19th century. The islands' sugar industry was hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834. Manpower was replaced with the importation of contract laborers from India between 1845 and 1917, which boosted sugar production as well as the cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added another important export. Independence was attained in 1962. The country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing. Tourism, mostly in Tobago, is targeted for expansion and is growing. The government is coping with a rise in violent crime.","geo":{"Location":"Caribbean, islands between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, northeast of Venezuela","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":11,"min":0},"W":{"deg":61,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":5128,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":5128,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

Economic growth between 2000 and 2007 averaged slightly over 8%, significantly above the regional average of about 3.7% for that same period; however, GDP has slowed down since then and contracted about 3.5% in 2009, before rising more than 2% in 2010. Growth has been fueled by investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG), petrochemicals, and steel. Additional petrochemical, aluminum, and plastics projects are in various stages of planning. Trinidad and Tobago is the leading Caribbean producer of oil and gas, and its economy is heavily dependent upon these resources but it also supplies manufactured goods, notably food products and beverages, as well as cement to the Caribbean region. Oil and gas account for about 40% of GDP and 80% of exports, but only 5% of employment. The country is also a regional financial center, and tourism is a growing sector, although it is not as important domestically as it is to many other Caribbean islands. The economy benefits from a growing trade surplus. The previous MANNING administration benefited from fiscal surpluses fueled by the dynamic export sector; however, declines in oil and gas prices have reduced government revenues which will challenge the new government's commitment to maintaining high levels of public investment.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":26100000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":20590000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":59.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":40.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":631000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"manufacturing, mining, and quarrying":{"quantity":12.8,"unit":"%"},"construction and utilities":{"quantity":20.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":62.9,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.4,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":11.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":6614000000},"expenditures":{"usd":7240000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":26.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":11.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":7.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.94,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":3734000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":12470000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2924000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":11150000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":7202000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":7034000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":151600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":43000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":248300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":92480,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":728300000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":39300000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":21940000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":17360000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":436100000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":3363000000},"Exports":{"usd":12060000000},"Imports":{"usd":8234000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":9659000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":4303000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":102000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":3829000000},"Exchange rates":"Trinidad and Tobago dollars (TTD) per US dollar -","industries":["petroleum and petroleum products, liquefied natural gas (LNG), methanol, ammonia, urea, steel products, beverages, food processing, cement, cotton textiles"],"agricultureProducts":["cocoa","rice","citrus","coffee","vegetables","poultry"],"exportCommodities":["petroleum and petroleum products","liquefied natural gas (LNG)","methanol","ammonia","urea","steel products","beverages","cereal and cereal products","sugar","cocoa","coffee","citrus fruit","vegetables","flowers"],"exportPartners":["US 38.53%","Jamaica 8.86%","Spain 6.88%","Mexico 6.23%"],"importCommodities":["mineral fuels","lubricants","machinery","transportation equipment","manufactured goods","food","chemicals","live animals"],"importPartners":["US 30.87%","Colombia 7.1%","Venezuela 7.01%","Russia 6.64%","Brazil 5.53%","China 4.19%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":314800,"Telephones - mobile cellular":1970000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"excellent international service;
