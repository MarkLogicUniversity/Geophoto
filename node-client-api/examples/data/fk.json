The colony was turned over to Spain two years later and the islands have since been the subject of a territorial dispute, first between Britain and Spain, then between Britain and Argentina. The UK asserted its claim to the islands by establishing a naval garrison there in 1833. Argentina invaded the islands on 2 April 1982. The British responded with an expeditionary force that landed seven weeks later and after fierce fighting forced an Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982.","geo":{"Location":"Southern South America, islands in the South Atlantic Ocean, east of southern Argentina","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":51,"min":45},"W":{"deg":59,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":12173,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":12173,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Connecticut","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1288,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive fishing zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"rocky, hilly, mountainous with some boggy, undulating plains","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Mount Usborne 705 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":"100% (99% permanent pastures, 1% other) (2005)"},"Irrigated land":"NA","Natural hazards":"strong winds persist throughout the year","naturalResources":["fish","squid","wildlife","calcified seaweed","sphagnum moss"],"environmentalIssues":["overfishing by unlicensed vessels is a problem","reindeer were introduced to the islands in 2001 for commercial reasons","this is the only commercial reindeer herd in the world unaffected by the 1986 Chornobyl disaster"],"climate":["cold marine","strong westerly winds, cloudy, humid","rain occurs on more than half of days in year","average annual rainfall is 24 inches in Stanley","occasional snow all year, except in January and February, but typically does not accumulate"],"geographyNote":["deeply indented coast provides good natural harbors","short growing season"]},"people":{"Population":3140,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"NA","15-64 years":"NA","65 years and over":"NA"},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":0.011,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":"NA","Death rate":"NA","Net migration rate":"NA","Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":74,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Major cities - population":"STANLEY (capital) 2,000 (2009)","Infant mortality rate":{"total":"NA","male":"NA","female":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"NA","male":"NA","female":"NA"},"Total fertility rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":"NA","HIV/AIDS - deaths":"NA","Nationality":{"noun":"Falkland Islander(s)","adjective":"Falkland Island"},"Literacy":"NA","School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":"NA","Education expenditures":"NA","ethnicGroups":["British"],"religions":["Christian 67.2%","none 31.5%","other 1.3% (2006 census)"],"languages":["English"]},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"none","conventional short form":"Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)"},"Dependency status":"overseas territory of the UK;

In 1987, the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falkland Islands' exclusive fishing zone. These license fees total more than $40 million per year, which help support the island's health, education, and welfare system. Squid accounts for 75% of the fish taken. Dairy farming supports domestic consumption; crops furnish winter fodder. Foreign exchange earnings come from shipments of high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. The islands are now self-financing except for defense. The British Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around the islands in 1993, and early seismic surveys suggest substantial reserves capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day; to date, no exploitable site has been identified. An agreement between Argentina and the UK in 1995 seeks to defuse licensing and sovereignty conflicts that would dampen foreign interest in exploiting potential oil reserves. Political tensions between the UK and Argentina rose in early 2010 after a UK company began oil drilling activities in the waters around the Falkland Islands but abated somewhat when the drilling operation failed to discover commercially exploitable oil reserves. Tourism, especially eco-tourism, is increasing rapidly, with about 30,000 visitors in 2001. Another large source of income is interest paid on money the government has in the bank. The British military presence also provides a sizeable economic boost.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":105100000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":105100000},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":95,"unit":"%"},"industry":"NA%","services":"NA% (1996)"},"Labor force":1724,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":95,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":66200000},"expenditures":{"usd":67900000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":16000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":14880000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":270.9,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":125000000},"Imports":{"usd":90000000},"Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Falkland pounds (FKP) per US dollar -","industries":["fish and wool processing","tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["fodder and vegetable crops","sheep","dairy products","fish","squid"],"exportCommodities":["wool","hides","meat","fish","squid"],"importCommodities":["fuel","food and drink","building materials","clothing"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":2000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":3300,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"NA","domestic":"government-operated radiotelephone and private VHF/CB radiotelephone networks provide effective service to almost all points on both islands","international":"country code - 500; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) with links through London to other countries"},"Broadcast media":"television service provided by a multi-channel service provider; radio services provided by the public broadcaster Falkland Islands Radio Service (FIRS), broadcasting on both AM and FM frequencies, and by the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) (2007)","Internet country code":".fk","Internet hosts":91,"Internet users":2900},"transport":{"Airports":7,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":2,"2,438 to 3,047 m":1,"914 to 1,523 m":1},"Airports - with unpaved runways":{"total":5,"under 914 m":5},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":440,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":50,"unit":"km"},"unpaved":{"quantity":390,"unit":"km"}},"Ports and terminals":"Stanley"},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces","Military expenditures":"NA","Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of the UK"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["Argentina, which claims the islands in its constitution and briefly occupied them by force in 1982, agreed in 1995 to no longer seek settlement by force","UK continues to reject Argentine requests for sovereignty talks"]}}
