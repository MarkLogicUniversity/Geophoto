{"code":"bg","name":"Bangladesh","region":"South Asia","background":"Europeans began to set up trading posts in the area of Bangladesh in the 16th century; eventually the British came to dominate the region and it became part of British India. In 1947, West Pakistan and East Bengal (both primarily Muslim) separated from India (largely Hindu) and jointly became the new country of Pakistan. East Bengal became East Pakistan in 1955, but the awkward arrangement of a two-part country with its territorial units separated by 1,600 km left the Bengalis marginalized and dissatisfied. East Pakistan seceded from its union with West Pakistan in 1971 and was renamed Bangladesh. A military-backed, emergency caretaker regime suspended parliamentary elections planned for January 2007 in an effort to reform the political system and root out corruption. In contrast to the strikes and violent street rallies that had marked Bangladeshi politics in previous years, the parliamentary elections finally held in late December 2008 were mostly peaceful and Sheikh HASINA Wajed was elected prime minister. About a third of this extremely poor country floods annually during the monsoon rainy season, hampering economic development.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Asia, bordering the Bay of Bengal, between Burma and India","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":24,"min":0},"E":{"deg":90,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":143998,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":130168,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":13830,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Iowa","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":4246,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Burma 193 km, India 4,053 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":580,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":18,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"up to the outer limits of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"mostly flat alluvial plain;
