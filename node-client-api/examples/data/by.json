{"code":"by","name":"Burundi","region":"Africa","background":"Burundi's first democratically elected president was assassinated in October 1993 after only 100 days in office, triggering widespread ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi factions. More than 200,000 Burundians perished during the conflict that spanned almost a dozen years. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians were internally displaced or became refugees in neighboring countries. An internationally brokered power-sharing agreement between the Tutsi-dominated government and the Hutu rebels in 2003 paved the way for a transition process that led to an integrated defense force, established a new constitution in 2005, and elected a majority Hutu government in 2005. The new government, led by President Pierre NKURUNZIZA, signed a South African brokered ceasefire with the country's last rebel group in September of 2006 but still faces many challenges.","geo":{"Location":"Central Africa, east of Democratic Republic of the Congo","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":3,"min":30},"E":{"deg":30,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":27830,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":25680,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":2150,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

The economy is predominantly agricultural which accounts for just over 30% of GDP and employs more than 90% of the population. Burundi's primary exports are coffee and tea, which account for 90% of foreign exchange earnings, though exports are a relatively small share of GDP. Burundi's export earnings - and its ability to pay for imports - rests primarily on weather conditions and international coffee and tea prices. The Tutsi minority, 14% of the population, dominates the coffee trade. An ethnic-based war that lasted for over a decade resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, forced more than 48,000 refugees into Tanzania, and displaced 140,000 others internally. Only one in two children go to school, and approximately one in 15 adults has HIV/AIDS. Food, medicine, and electricity remain in short supply. Less than 2% of the population has electricity in its homes. Burundi's GDP grew around 4% annually in 2006-10. Political stability and the end of the civil war have improved aid flows and economic activity has increased, but underlying weaknesses - a high poverty rate, poor education rates, a weak legal system, a poor transportation network, overburdened utilities, and low administrative capacity - risk undermining planned economic reforms. The purchasing power of most Burundians has decreased as wage increases have not kept up with inflation. Burundi will continue to remain heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and multilateral donors; the delay of funds after a corruption scandal cut off bilateral aid in 2007 reduced government's revenues and its ability to pay salaries. Burundi joined the East African Community, which should boost Burundi's regional trade ties, and received $700 million in debt relief in 2009. Government corruption is also hindering the development of a healthy private sector as companies seek to navigate an environment with ever-changing rules.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":3397000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1489000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":31.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":21.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":47,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4245000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":93.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":68,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":28,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":42.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":25.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":386300000},"expenditures":{"usd":476200000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":9.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":14.08,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":329300000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":568300000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":465700000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":92000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":125600000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":"40 million kWh;
