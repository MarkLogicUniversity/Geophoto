{"code":"um","name":"United States Pacific Island Wildlife Refuges","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"All of the following US Pacific island territories except Midway Atoll constitute the Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) Complex and as such are managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service of the US Department of the Interior. Midway Atoll NWR has been included in a Refuge Complex with the Hawaiian Islands NWR and also designated as part of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. These remote refuges are the most widespread collection of marine- and terrestrial-life protected areas on the planet under a single country's jurisdiction. They sustain many endemic species including corals, fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds, water birds, land birds, insects, and vegetation not found elsewhere.","geo":{"Location":{"Location":"Oceania","Baker Island":"atoll in the North Pacific Ocean 1,830 nm (3,389 km) southwest of Honolulu, about half way between Hawaii and Australia","Howland Island":"island in the North Pacific Ocean 1,815 nm (3,361 km) southwest of Honolulu, about half way between Hawaii and Australia","Jarvis Island":"island in the South Pacific Ocean 1,305 nm (2,417 km) south of Honolulu, about half way between Hawaii and Cook Islands","Johnston Atoll":"atoll in the North Pacific Ocean 717 nm (1,328 km) southwest of Honolulu, about one-third of the way from Hawaii to the Marshall Islands","Kingman Reef":"reef in the North Pacific Ocean 930 nm (1,722 km) south of Honolulu, about half way between Hawaii and American Samoa"},"Geographic coordinates":{"Baker Island":{"N":{"deg":0,"min":13},"W":{"deg":176,"min":28}},"Howland Island":{"N":{"deg":0,"min":48},"W":{"deg":176,"min":38}},"Jarvis Island":{"S":{"deg":0,"min":23},"W":{"deg":160,"min":1}},"Johnston Atoll":{"N":{"deg":16,"min":45},"W":{"deg":169,"min":31}},"Kingman Reef":{"N":{"deg":6,"min":23},"W":{"deg":162,"min":25}}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"Area":"total - 6,959.41 sq km;
