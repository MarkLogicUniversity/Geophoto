Stiff resistance to the Red Army after the Bolshevik Revolution was eventually suppressed and a socialist republic established in 1924. During the Soviet era, intensive production of \"white gold\" (cotton) and grain led to overuse of agrochemicals and the depletion of water supplies, which have left the land poisoned and the Aral Sea and certain rivers half dry. Independent since 1991, the country seeks to gradually lessen its dependence on agriculture while developing its mineral and petroleum reserves. Current concerns include terrorism by Islamic militants, economic stagnation, and the curtailment of human rights and democratization.","geo":{"Location":"Central Asia, north of Turkmenistan, south of Kazakhstan","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":41,"min":0},"E":{"deg":64,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":447400,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":425400,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":22000,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than California","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":6221,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Afghanistan 137 km, Kazakhstan 2,203 km, Kyrgyzstan 1,099 km, Tajikistan 1,161 km, Turkmenistan 1,621 km"},"Coastline":"0 km (doubly landlocked);

More than 60% of the population lives in densely populated rural communities. Export of hydrocarbons, including natural gas and petroleum, provided about 40% of foreign exchange earnings in 2009. Other major export earners include gold and cotton. Uzbekistan is now the world's second-largest cotton exporter and fifth largest producer; it has come under increasing international criticism for the use of child labor in its annual cotton harvest. Nevertheless, Uzbekistan enjoyed a bumper cotton crop in 2010 amidst record high prices. Following independence in September 1991, the government sought to prop up its Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and tight controls on production and prices. While aware of the need to improve the investment climate, the government still sponsors measures that often increase, not decrease, its control over business decisions. A sharp increase in the inequality of income distribution has hurt the lower ranks of society since independence. In 2003, the government accepted Article VIII obligations under the IMF, providing for full currency convertibility. However, strict currency controls and tightening of borders have lessened the effects of convertibility and have also led to some shortages that have further stifled economic activity. The Central Bank often delays or restricts convertibility, especially for consumer goods. Potential investment by Russia and China in Uzbekistan's gas and oil industry, as well as increased cooperation with South Korea in the realm of civil aviation, may boost growth prospects. However, decreased demand for natural gas in Europe and Russia in the wake of the global financial crisis could reduce energy-related revenues in the near term. In November 2005, Russian President Vladimir PUTIN and Uzbekistan President KARIMOV signed an \"alliance,\" which included provisions for economic and business cooperation. Russian businesses have shown increased interest in Uzbekistan, especially in mining, telecom, and oil and gas. In 2006, Uzbekistan took steps to rejoin the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and the Eurasian Economic Community (EurASEC), which it subsequently left in 2008, both organizations dominated by Russia. In the past Uzbek authorities had accused US and other foreign companies operating in Uzbekistan of violating Uzbek tax laws and have frozen their assets, but no new expropriations occurred in 2008-09. Instead, the Uzbek Government has actively courted several major U.S. and international corporations, offering attractive financing and tax advantages, and has landed a significant US investment in the automotive industry. Although growth slowed in 2009-10, Uzbekistan has seen few other effects from the global economic downturn, primarily due to its relative isolation from the global financial markets.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":85850000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":38990000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":21.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":32.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":46.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":16000000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":44,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":36,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":29.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":36.8,"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":12250000000},"expenditures":{"usd":12300000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4895000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":7197000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":6482000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":44800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":40100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":11520000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":11440000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":70910,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":145000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":6104,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":35810,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":594000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":67599999999.99999,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":52600000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":15000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1841000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":5588000000},"Exports":{"usd":13130000000},"Imports":{"usd":9440000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":10500000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":4236000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Uzbekistani soum (UZS) per US dollar -","industries":["textiles, food processing, machine building, metallurgy, gold, petroleum, natural gas, chemicals"],"agricultureProducts":["cotton","vegetables","fruits","grain","livestock"],"exportCommodities":["energy products","cotton","gold","mineral fertilizers","ferrous and nonferrous metals","textiles","food products","machinery","automobiles"],"exportPartners":["Ukraine 29.91%","Russia 13.94%","Turkey 7.53%","Kazakhstan 7.26%","Bangladesh 6.83%","China 5.69%","South Korea 4.19%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","foodstuffs","chemicals","ferrous and nonferrous metals"],"importPartners":["Russia 23.72%","China 20.36%","South Korea 13.03%","Germany 6.09%","Ukraine 5.39%","Kazakhstan 4.68%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1857000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":16418000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"digital exchanges in large cities but still antiquated and inadequate in rural areas","domestic":"the state-owned telecommunications company, Uzbektelecom, owner of the fixed line telecommunications system, has used loans from the Japanese government and the China Development Bank to upgrade fixed-line services including conversion to digital exchanges;
