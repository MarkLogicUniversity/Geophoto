After World War II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established an autocratic socialist system that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After 1978, MAO's successor DENG Xiaoping and other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by 2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population, living standards have improved dramatically and the room for personal choice has expanded, yet political controls remain tight. China since the early 1990s has increased its global outreach and participation in international organizations.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Asia, bordering the East China Sea, Korea Bay, Yellow Sea, and South China Sea, between North Korea and Vietnam","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":35,"min":0},"E":{"deg":105,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":9596,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":9569,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":27060,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than the US","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":22117,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Afghanistan 76 km, Bhutan 470 km, Burma 2,185 km, India 3,380 km, Kazakhstan 1,533 km, North Korea 1,416 km, Kyrgyzstan 858 km, Laos 423 km, Mongolia 4,677 km, Nepal 1,236 km, Pakistan 523 km, Russia (northeast) 3,605 km, Russia (northwest) 40 km, Tajikistan 414 km, Vietnam 1,281 km","regional borders":"Hong Kong 30 km, Macau 0.34 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":14500,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"mostly mountains, high plateaus, deserts in west;

Reforms began with the phasing out of collectivized agriculture, and expanded to include the gradual liberalization of prices, fiscal decentralization, increased autonomy for state enterprises, creation of a diversified banking system, development of stock markets, rapid growth of the private sector, and opening to foreign trade and investment. China has implemented reforms in a gradualist fashion. In recent years, China has renewed its support for state-owned enterprises in sectors it considers important to \"economic security,\" explicitly looking to foster globally competitive national champions. After keeping its currency tightly linked to the US dollar for years, in July 2005 China revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US dollar and moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies. From mid 2005 to late 2008 cumulative appreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar was more than 20%, but the exchange rate remained virtually pegged to the dollar from the onset of the global financial crisis until June 2010, when Beijing allowed resumption of a gradual appreciation. The restructuring of the economy and resulting efficiency gains have contributed to a more than tenfold increase in GDP since 1978. Measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis that adjusts for price differences, China in 2010 stood as the second-largest economy in the world after the US, having surpassed Japan in 2001. The dollar values of China's agricultural and industrial output each exceed those of the US; China is second to the US in the value of services it produces. Still, per capita income is below the world average. The Chinese government faces numerous economic challenges, including: (a) reducing its high domestic savings rate and correspondingly low domestic demand; (b) sustaining adequate job growth for tens of millions of migrants and new entrants to the work force; (c) reducing corruption and other economic crimes; and (d) containing environmental damage and social strife related to the economy's rapid transformation. Economic development has progressed further in coastal provinces than in the interior, and approximately 200 million rural laborers and their dependents have relocated to urban areas to find work. One consequence of the \"one child\" policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world. Deterioration in the environment - notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall of the water table, especially in the north - is another long-term problem. China continues to lose arable land because of erosion and economic development. The Chinese government is seeking to add energy production capacity from sources other than coal and oil, focusing on nuclear and alternative energy development. In 2009, the global economic downturn reduced foreign demand for Chinese exports for the first time in many years, but China rebounded quickly, outperforming all other major economies in 2010 with GDP growth around 10%. The economy appears set to remain on a strong growth trajectory in 2011, lending credibility to the stimulus policies the regime rolled out during the global financial crisis. The government vows, in the 12th Five-Year Plan adopted in March 2011, to continue reforming the economy and emphasizes the need to increase domestic consumption in order to make the economy less dependent on exports for GDP growth in the future. However, China likely will make only marginal progress toward these rebalancing goals in 2011. Two economic problems China currently faces are inflation - which, late in 2010, surpassed the government's target of 3% - and local government debt, which swelled as a result of stimulus policies, and is largely off-the-books and potentially low-quality.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":10090000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5878000000000}},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":10.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":9.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":46.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":43.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":780000000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":38.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":27.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":34.1,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":4.3,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"}},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":41.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":47.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1149000000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1270000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":17.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":2.79,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.81,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":3838000000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":10080000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":8156000000000.001},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":5008000000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":3451000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":3438000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":16640000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":3842000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":3991000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":8199999.999999999,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":388000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4393000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":20350000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":82940000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":87080000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":3320000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":7462000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":3030000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":272500000000},"Exports":{"usd":1506000000000},"Imports":{"usd":1307000000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2622000000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":406600000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":574300000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":278900000000},"Exchange rates":"Renminbi yuan (RMB) per US dollar -","industries":["world leader in gross value of industrial output","mining and ore processing, iron, steel, aluminum, and other metals, coal","machine building","armaments","textiles and apparel","petroleum","cement","chemicals","fertilizers","consumer products, including footwear, toys, and electronics","food processing","transportation equipment, including automobiles, rail cars and locomotives, ships, and aircraft","telecommunications equipment, commercial space launch vehicles, satellites"],"agricultureProducts":["world leader in gross value of agricultural output","rice","wheat","potatoes","corn","peanuts","tea","millet","barley","apples","cotton","oilseed","pork","fish"],"exportCommodities":["electrical and other machinery","including data processing equipment","apparel","textiles","iron and steel","optical and medical equipment"],"exportPartners":["US 20.03%","Hong Kong 12.03%","Japan 8.32%","South Korea 4.55%","Germany 4.27%"],"importCommodities":["electrical and other machinery","oil and mineral fuels","optical and medical equipment","metal ores","plastics","organic chemicals"],"importPartners":["Japan 12.27%","Hong Kong 10.06%","South Korea 9.04%","US 7.66%","Taiwan 6.84%","Germany 5.54%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":313680000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":747000000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"domestic and international services are increasingly available for private use;
