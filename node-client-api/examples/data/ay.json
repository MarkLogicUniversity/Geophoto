Not until 1840 was it established that Antarctica was indeed a continent and not just a group of islands or an area of ocean. Several exploration \"firsts\" were achieved in the early 20th century, but generally the area saw little human activity. Following World War II, however, there was an upsurge in scientific research on the continent. A number of countries have set up a range of year-round and seasonal stations, camps, and refuges to support scientific research in Antarctica. Seven have made territorial claims, but not all countries recognize these claims. In order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on the continent, an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies nor gives recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in 1959, it entered into force in 1961.","geo":{"Location":"continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":90,"min":0},"E":{"deg":0,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":14000000,"unit":"sq km"},"land":"14 million sq km (280,000 sq km ice-free, 13.72 million sq km ice-covered) (est.)"},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US","Land boundaries":{"Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"}},"Coastline":{"quantity":17968,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"Australia, Chile, and Argentina claim Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) rights or similar over 200 nm extensions seaward from their continental claims, but like the claims themselves, these zones are not accepted by other countries; 21 of 28 Antarctic consultative nations have made no claims to Antarctic territory (although Russia and the US have reserved the right to do so) and do not recognize the claims of the other nations; also see the Disputes - international entry","Terrain":"about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock, with average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain ranges up to nearly 5,000 meters; ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and parts of Ross Island on McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves along about half of the coastline, and floating ice shelves constitute 11% of the area of the continent","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Bentley Subglacial Trench -2,540 m","highest point":"Vinson Massif 4,897 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":"100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%) (2005)"},"Natural hazards":"katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau; cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise along the coast; volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of West Antarctica; other seismic activity rare and weak; large icebergs may calve from ice shelf","naturalResources":["iron ore","chromium","copper","gold","nickel","platinum and other minerals","and coal and hydrocarbons have been found in small uncommercial quantities","none presently exploited","krill","finfish","and crab have been taken by commercial fisheries"],"environmentalIssues":["in 1998, NASA satellite data showed that the Antarctic ozone hole was the largest on record, covering 27 million square kilometers","researchers in 1997 found that increased ultraviolet light passing through the hole damages the DNA of icefish, an Antarctic fish lacking hemoglobin","ozone depletion earlier was shown to harm one-celled Antarctic marine plants","in 2002, significant areas of ice shelves disintegrated in response to regional warming"],"climate":["severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance from the ocean","East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher elevation","Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate","higher temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below freezing"],"geographyNote":["the coldest, windiest, highest (on average), and driest continent","during summer, more solar radiation reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an equivalent period","mostly uninhabitable"]},"people":{"Population":{"Population":"no indigenous inhabitants, but there are both permanent and summer-only staffed research stations"}},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"none","conventional short form":"Antarctica"},"Government type":"Antarctic Treaty Summary - the Antarctic region is governed by a system known as the Antarctic Treaty System; the system includes: 1. the Antarctic Treaty, signed on 1 December 1959 and entered into force on 23 June 1961, which establishes the legal framework for the management of Antarctica, 2.

Fishing off the coast and tourism, both based abroad, account for Antarctica's limited economic activity. Antarctic fisheries, targeting three main species - Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides and D. mawsoni), mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari), and krill (Euphausia superba) - reported landing 141,147 metric tons in 2008-09 (1 July - 30 June). (Estimated fishing is from the area covered by the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which extends slightly beyond the Antarctic Treaty area.) Unregulated fishing, particularly of Patagonian toothfish (also known as Chilean sea bass), is a serious problem. The CCAMLR determines the recommended catch limits for marine species. A total of 37,858 tourists visited the Antarctic Treaty area in the 2008-09 Antarctic summer, down from the 46,265 visitors in 2007-2008 (estimates provided to the Antarctic Treaty by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO); this does not include passengers on overflights).
