{"code":"to","name":"Togo","region":"Africa","background":"French Togoland became Togo in 1960. Gen. Gnassingbe EYADEMA, installed as military ruler in 1967, ruled Togo with a heavy hand for almost four decades. Despite the facade of multiparty elections instituted in the early 1990s, the government was largely dominated by President EYADEMA, whose Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) party has maintained power almost continually since 1967 and maintains a majority of seats in today's legislature. Upon EYADEMA's death in February 2005, the military installed the president's son, Faure GNASSINGBE, and then engineered his formal election two months later. Democratic gains since then allowed Togo to hold its first relatively free and fair legislative elections in October 2007. After years of political unrest and condemnation from international organizations for human rights abuses, Togo is finally being re-welcomed into the international community.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the Bight of Benin, between Benin and Ghana","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":8,"min":0},"E":{"deg":1,"min":10}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":56785,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":54385,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":2400,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than West Virginia","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1647,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Benin 644 km, Burkina Faso 126 km, Ghana 877 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":56,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":30,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"gently rolling savanna in north;

Some basic foodstuffs must still be imported. Cocoa, coffee, and cotton generate about 40% of export earnings with cotton being the most important cash crop. Togo is the world's fourth-largest producer of phosphate. The government's decade-long effort, supported by the World Bank and the IMF, to implement economic reform measures, encourage foreign investment, and bring revenues in line with expenditures has moved slowly. Progress depends on follow through on privatization, increased openness in government financial operations, progress toward legislative elections, and continued support from foreign donors. Togo is on track with its IMF Extended Credit Facility and reached a HIPC debt relief completion point in 2010 at which 95% of the country's debt was forgiven. Economic growth prospects remain marginal due to declining cotton production and underinvestment in phosphate mining.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":5974000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":3194000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":47.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":25.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":27.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2595000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":65,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":32,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":27.1,"unit":"%"}},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":602300000},"expenditures":{"usd":692100000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":754500000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1238000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":817700000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":230000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":640000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":"514 million kWh;
