Still, it faces many of the serious problems confronting other underdeveloped countries, such as stagnant per capita income, a relatively inequitable distribution of income, a top-heavy civil service, endemic corruption, and a generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. Since 1990, the government has embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and recapitalize the nation's banks. The IMF is pressing for more reforms, including increased budget transparency, privatization, and poverty reduction programs. Weak prices for oil led to the significant slowdown in growth in 2010. The government is under pressure to reduce its budget deficit, which by the government's own forecast will hit 2.8% of GDP, but the presidential election in 2011 may make fiscal austerity difficult.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":44330000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":22480000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":30.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":49.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":7836000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":48,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":35.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":44.6,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":3779000000},"expenditures":{"usd":4340000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":9.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":2888000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4831000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":848800000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":5601000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":4801000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":77310,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":26000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":107100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":45520,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":200000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":"NA cu m (2008 est.)","Natural gas - consumption":"NA cu m (2008 est.)","Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":135100000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-826 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":4371000000},"Imports":{"usd":4869000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":4022999999.9999995},"Debt - external":{"usd":3344000000},"Exchange rates":"Cooperation Financiere en Afrique Centrale francs","industries":["petroleum production and refining, aluminum production, food processing, light consumer goods, textiles, lumber, ship repair"],"agricultureProducts":["coffee","cocoa","cotton","rubber","bananas","oilseed","grains","root starches","livestock","timber"],"exportCommodities":["crude oil and petroleum products","lumber","cocoa beans","aluminum","coffee","cotton"],"exportPartners":["Netherlands 13.99%","Spain 12.25%","Italy 11.84%","China 9.14%","US 6.16%","France 5.51%","South Korea 4.66%","Belgium 4.33%","UK 4%"],"importCommodities":["machinery","electrical equipment","transport equipment","fuel","food"],"importPartners":["France 21.03%","Nigeria 10.79%","China 10.25%","Belgium 6.62%","US 4.31%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":323800,"Telephones - mobile cellular":7397000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"system includes cable, microwave radio relay, and tropospheric scatter;
