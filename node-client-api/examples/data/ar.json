{"code":"ar","name":"Argentina","region":"South America","background":"In 1816, the United Provinces of the Rio Plata declared their independence from Spain. After Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay went their separate ways, the area that remained became Argentina. The country's population and culture were heavily shaped by immigrants from throughout Europe, but most particularly Italy and Spain, which provided the largest percentage of newcomers from 1860 to 1930. Up until about the mid-20th century, much of Argentina's history was dominated by periods of internal political conflict between Federalists and Unitarians and between civilian and military factions. After World War II, an era of Peronist populism and direct and indirect military interference in subsequent governments was followed by a military junta that took power in 1976. Democracy returned in 1983 after a failed bid to seize the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands by force, and has persisted despite numerous challenges, the most formidable of which was a severe economic crisis in 2001-02 that led to violent public protests and the successive resignations of several presidents.","geo":{"Location":"Southern South America, bordering the South Atlantic Ocean, between Chile and Uruguay","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":34,"min":0},"W":{"deg":64,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":2780,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":2736,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":43710,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than three-tenths the size of the US","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":9861,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Bolivia 832 km, Brazil 1,261 km, Chile 5,308 km, Paraguay 1,880 km, Uruguay 580 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":4989,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"rich plains of the Pampas in northern half, flat to rolling plateau of Patagonia in south, rugged Andes along western border","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Laguna del Carbon -105 m (located between Puerto San Julian and Comandante Luis Piedra Buena in the province of Santa Cruz)","highest point":"Cerro Aconcagua 6,960 m (located in the northwestern corner of the province of Mendoza)"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":10.03,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.36,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":89.61,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":15500,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":814,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":29.19,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":753,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"San Miguel de Tucuman and Mendoza areas in the Andes subject to earthquakes;

Although one of the world's wealthiest countries 100 years ago, Argentina suffered during most of the 20th century from recurring economic crises, persistent fiscal and current account deficits, high inflation, mounting external debt, and capital flight. A severe depression, growing public and external indebtedness, and a bank run culminated in 2001 in the most serious economic, social, and political crisis in the country's turbulent history. Interim President Adolfo RODRIGUEZ SAA declared a default - the largest in history - on the government's foreign debt in December of that year, and abruptly resigned only a few days after taking office. His successor, Eduardo DUHALDE, announced an end to the peso's decade-long 1-to-1 peg to the US dollar in early 2002. The economy bottomed out that year, with real GDP 18% smaller than in 1998 and almost 60% of Argentines under the poverty line. Real GDP rebounded to grow by an average 8.5% annually over the subsequent six years, taking advantage of previously idled industrial capacity and labor, an audacious debt restructuring and reduced debt burden, excellent international financial conditions, and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. Inflation also increased, however, during the administration of President Nestor KIRCHNER, which responded with price restraints on businesses, as well as export taxes and restraints, and beginning in early 2007, with understating inflation data. Cristina FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER succeeded her husband as President in late 2007, and the rapid economic growth of previous years began to slow sharply the following year as government policies held back exports and the world economy fell into recession. The economy has rebounded strongly from the 2009 recession, but the government's continued reliance on expansionary fiscal and monetary policies risks exacerbating already high inflation.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":596000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":370300000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":31.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":59.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":16620000.000000002,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":72,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"}},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":29.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":"41.4 3rd quarter, 2010","Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":87630000000},"expenditures":{"usd":86850000000}},"Public debt":{"Public debt":{"quantity":50.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.3,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":40350000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":112900000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":113900000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":48930000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8.9,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":109500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":99210000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":2628000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":10280000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":796300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":622000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":314400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":52290,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":2386000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":41360000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":43140000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":890000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":2660000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":398400000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":6976000000},"Exports":{"usd":68500000000},"Imports":{"usd":56440000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":53610000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":160900000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":86800000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":30160000000},"Exchange rates":"Argentine pesos (ARS) per US dollar -","industries":["food processing, motor vehicles, consumer durables, textiles, chemicals and petrochemicals, printing, metallurgy, steel"],"agricultureProducts":["sunflower seeds","lemons","soybeans","grapes","corn","tobacco","peanuts","tea","wheat","livestock"],"exportCommodities":["soybeans and derivatives","petroleum and gas","vehicles","corn","wheat"],"exportPartners":["Brazil 18.78%","China 9.26%","Chile 7.11%","US 6.38%"],"importCommodities":["machinery","motor vehicles","petroleum and natural gas","organic chemicals","plastics"],"importPartners":["Brazil 31.12%","US 13.69%","China 10.26%","Germany 4.69%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":9764000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":51891000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"the \"Telecommunications Liberalization Plan of 1998\" opened the telecommunications market to competition and foreign investment encouraging the growth of modern telecommunications technology;
