{"code":"np","name":"Nepal","region":"South Asia","background":"In 1951, the Nepalese monarch ended the century-old system of rule by hereditary premiers and instituted a cabinet system of government. Reforms in 1990 established a multiparty democracy within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. An insurgency led by Maoist extremists broke out in 1996. The ensuing ten-year civil war between insurgents and government forces witnessed the dissolution of the cabinet and parliament and assumption of absolute power by the king. Several weeks of mass protests in April 2006 were followed by several months of peace negotiations between the Maoists and government officials, and culminated in a November 2006 peace accord and the promulgation of an interim constitution. Following a nation-wide election in April 2008, the newly formed Constituent Assembly declared Nepal a federal democratic republic and abolished the monarchy at its first meeting the following month. The Constituent Assembly elected the country's first president in July. The Maoists, who received a plurality of votes in the Constituent Assembly election, formed a coalition government in August 2008, but resigned in May 2009 after the president overruled a decision to fire the chief of the army staff. The Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist-Leninist and the Nepali Congress party then formed a new coalition government with several smaller parties. The prime minister's resignation in June 2010 ushered in seven months of political gridlock until Jhala Nath KHANAL was elected as replacement in February 2011. His pressing tasks are to conclude the drafting of a new constitution by the late May 2011 deadline and to determine the future of the former Maoist combatants.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Asia, between China and India","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":28,"min":0},"E":{"deg":84,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":147181,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":143351,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":3830,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Arkansas","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":2926,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"China 1,236 km, India 1,690 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"Tarai or flat river plain of the Ganges in south, central hill region, rugged Himalayas in north","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Kanchan Kalan 70 m","highest point":"Mount Everest 8,850 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":16.07,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.85,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":83.08,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":11680,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":210.2,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":10.18,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":375,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"severe thunderstorms;

Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for three-fourths of the population and accounting for about one-third of GDP. Industrial activity mainly involves the processing of agricultural products, including pulses, jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. Nepal has considerable scope for exploiting its potential in hydropower, with an estimated 42,000 MW of feasible capacity, but political instability hampers foreign investment. Additional challenges to Nepal's growth include its landlocked geographic location, civil strife and labor unrest, and its susceptibility to natural disaster.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":35810000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":15840000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":33,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":52,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":18000000,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":75,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":46,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":24.7,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA","highest 10%":{"quantity":40.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":47.2,"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":3000000000},"expenditures":{"usd":4600000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":8.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":3030000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":9000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":6110000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":5200000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":2600000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2243000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":213000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":18000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":16920,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-449 million (2010)","Exports":{"usd":849000000},"Imports":{"usd":5260000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":4500000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Nepalese rupees (NPR) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, carpets, textiles","small rice, jute, sugar, and oilseed mills","cigarettes, cement and brick production"],"agricultureProducts":["pulses","rice","corn","wheat","sugarcane","jute","root crops","milk","water buffalo meat"],"exportCommodities":["clothing","pulses","carpets","textiles","juice","pashima","jute goods"],"exportPartners":["India 65.6%","US 8%","Bangladesh 6.04%","Germany 5%"],"importCommodities":["petroleum products","machinery and equipment","gold","electrical goods","medicine"],"importPartners":["India 57%","China 13%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":820500,"Telephones - mobile cellular":7618000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"poor telephone and telegraph service;
