The sector accounts for about 95% of exports and nearly half of GDP. In early 2008 the Faroese economy began to slow as a result of smaller catches and historically high oil prices that continue to trouble the economy. Reduced catches, especially of cod and haddock, have continued to strain the Faroese economy. GDP grew 0.5% in 2008-09. The slowdown in the Faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid-1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6%, mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming, and high export prices. Unemployment reached its lowest level in the first half of 2008, but increased to 3.9% in 2009 and is rising. The Faroese Home Rule Government produced increasing budget surpluses that helped to reduce the large public debt, most of it to Denmark. However, total dependence on fishing and salmon farming make the Faroese economy very vulnerable to fluctuations in world demand. In addition, budget surpluses turned to deficits in 2008-09, and the economy at both the country and local level is running large deficits. Initial discoveries of oil in the Faroese area give hope for eventual oil production, which may provide a foundation for a more diversified economy and less dependence on Danish economic assistance. Aided by an annual subsidy from Denmark amounting to about 6% of Faroese GDP, the Faroese have a standard of living almost equal to that of Denmark and Greenland.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1590000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":2450000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":29,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":55,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":34680,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":10.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":69.2,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1163000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1139000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"-1.1% (2009)","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":275800000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":264399999.99999997,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":5000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4922,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":848000000},"Imports":{"usd":983000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":68100000},"Exchange rates":"Danish kroner (DKK) per US dollar -","industries":["fishing, fish processing, small ship repair and refurbishment, handicrafts"],"agricultureProducts":["milk","potatoes","vegetables","sheep","salmon","other fish"],"exportCommodities":["fish and fish products 94%","stamps","ships"],"exportPartners":["Hungary 36.26%","Denmark 21.36%","UK 12.21%","Nigeria 7.72%","US 6.49%","Norway 5.46%"],"importCommodities":["consumer goods 36%","raw materials and semi-manufactures 32%","machinery and transport equipment 29%","fuels","fish","salt"],"importPartners":["Denmark 54.42%","Norway 20.76%","Sweden 4.79%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":20900,"Telephones - mobile cellular":57000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"good international communications; good domestic facilities","domestic":"conversion to digital system completed in 1998; both NMT (analog) and GSM (digital) mobile telephone systems are installed","international":"country code - 298; satellite earth stations - 1 Orion; 1 fiber-optic submarine cable to the Shetland Islands, linking the Faroe Islands with Denmark and Iceland; fiber-optic submarine cable connection to Canada-Europe cable"},"Broadcast media":"1 publicly-owned TV station; the Faroese telecommunications company distributes local and international channels through its digital terrestrial network; publicly-owned radio station supplemented by 2 privately-owned stations broadcasting over multiple frequencies (2008)","Internet country code":".fo","Internet hosts":8936,"Internet users":37500},"transport":{"Airports":1,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":1,"914 to 1,523 m":1},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":463,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Merchant marine":{"total":26,"country comparison to the world":"","by type":"cargo 11, chemical tanker 6, container 2, passenger 1, passenger/cargo 3, refrigerated cargo 2, roll on/roll off 1","foreign-owned":"11 (Norway 6, Sweden 5) (2010)"},"Ports and terminals":"Fuglafjordur, Torshavn, Vagur"},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":11831},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":9827,"females age 16-49":8418},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":372,"female":373},"Military expenditures":"NA","Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of Denmark"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["because anticipated offshore hydrocarbon resources have not been realized, earlier Faroese proposals for full independence have been deferred","Iceland, the UK, and Ireland dispute Denmark's claim that the Faroe Islands' continental shelf extends beyond 200 nm"]}}
