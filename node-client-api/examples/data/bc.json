Through fiscal discipline and sound management, Botswana transformed itself from one of the poorest countries in the world to a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of $13,100 in 2010. Two major investment services rank Botswana as the best credit risk in Africa. Diamond mining has fueled much of the expansion and currently accounts for more than one-third of GDP, 70-80% of export earnings, and about half of the government's revenues. Botswana's heavy reliance on a single luxury export was a critical factor in the sharp economic contraction of 2009. Tourism, financial services, subsistence farming, and cattle raising are other key sectors. Although unemployment was 7.5% in 2007 according to official reports, unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS is second highest in the world and threatens Botswana's impressive economic gains. An expected leveling off in diamond mining production within the next two decades overshadows long-term prospects.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":28490000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":14030000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":8.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":45.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":51.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":"685,300 formal sector employees (2007)","Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":"NA%"},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":30.3,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":63,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":28.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":4165000000},"expenditures":{"usd":5888000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":22.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":13.76,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1146000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":6679000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1361000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":3991000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6.9,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1052000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2648000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":2181000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":15000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":15180,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-552 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":4419000000},"Imports":{"usd":4518000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":7834000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2222000000},"Exchange rates":"pulas (BWP) per US dollar -","industries":["diamonds, copper, nickel, salt, soda ash, potash, coal, iron ore, silver","livestock processing","textiles"],"agricultureProducts":["livestock","sorghum","maize","millet","beans","sunflowers","groundnuts"],"exportCommodities":["diamonds","copper","nickel","soda ash","meat","textiles"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","machinery","electrical goods","transport equipment","textiles","fuel and petroleum products","wood and paper products","metal and metal products"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":144200,"Telephones - mobile cellular":1874000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"Botswana is participating in regional development efforts;
