{"code":"bu","name":"Bulgaria","region":"Europe","background":"The Bulgars, a Central Asian Turkic tribe, merged with the local Slavic inhabitants in the late 7th century to form the first Bulgarian state. In succeeding centuries, Bulgaria struggled with the Byzantine Empire to assert its place in the Balkans, but by the end of the 14th century the country was overrun by the Ottoman Turks. Northern Bulgaria attained autonomy in 1878 and all of Bulgaria became independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1908. Having fought on the losing side in both World Wars, Bulgaria fell within the Soviet sphere of influence and became a People's Republic in 1946. Communist domination ended in 1990, when Bulgaria held its first multiparty election since World War II and began the contentious process of moving toward political democracy and a market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption, and crime. The country joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Europe, bordering the Black Sea, between Romania and Turkey","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":43,"min":0},"E":{"deg":25,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":110879,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":108489,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":2390,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Tennessee","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1808,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Greece 494 km, Macedonia 148 km, Romania 608 km, Serbia 318 km, Turkey 240 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":354,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"mostly mountains with lowlands in north and southeast","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Black Sea 0 m","highest point":"Musala 2,925 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":29.94,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":68.16,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":1020,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":19.4,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":6.92,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":895,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"earthquakes;

Successive governments have demonstrated a commitment to economic reforms and responsible fiscal planning, but the global downturn sharply reduced domestic demand, exports, capital inflows, and industrial production. GDP contracted by approximately 5% in 2009, and stagnated in 2010, despite a significant recovery in exports. The economy is expected to grow modestly in 2011, however. Corruption in the public administration, a weak judiciary, and the presence of organized crime remain significant challenges.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":96780000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":47700000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":30.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":63.7,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3400000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":7.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":35.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":57.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":9.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":21.8,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":33.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":15710000000},"expenditures":{"usd":17520000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":16.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"}},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.34,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":12700000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":35370000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":34540000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":6354000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":0.4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":4309000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":28300000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":7073000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":2660000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":3227,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":125000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":76570,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":189000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":15000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":54000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":2620000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":2480000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":5663000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-12.8 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":19330000000},"Imports":{"usd":22780000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":17270000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":47150000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":51280000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1372000000},"Exchange rates":"leva (BGN) per US dollar -","industries":["electricity, gas, water","food, beverages, tobacco","machinery and equipment, base metals, chemical products, coke, refined petroleum, nuclear fuel"],"agricultureProducts":["vegetables","fruits","tobacco","wine","wheat","barley","sunflowers","sugar beets","livestock"],"exportCommodities":["clothing","footwear","iron and steel","machinery and equipment","fuels"],"exportPartners":["Germany 11.21%","Greece 9.43%","Italy 9.24%","Romania 8.52%","Turkey 7.33%","Belgium 5.61%","France 4.44%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","metals and ores","chemicals and plastics","fuels","minerals","and raw materials"],"importPartners":["Russia 13.14%","Germany 12.23%","Italy 7.78%","Greece 6.17%","Romania 5.65%","Turkey 5.48%","Ukraine 4.81%","Austria 4.08%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":2164000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":10617000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"inherited an extensive but antiquated telecommunications network from the Soviet era;
