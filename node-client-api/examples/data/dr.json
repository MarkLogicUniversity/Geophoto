{"code":"dr","name":"Dominican Republic","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"The Taino - indigenous inhabitants of Hispaniola prior to the arrival of the Europeans - divided the island into five chiefdoms and territories. Christopher COLUMBUS explored and claimed the island on his first voyage in 1492; it became a springboard for Spanish conquest of the Caribbean and the American mainland. In 1697, Spain recognized French dominion over the western third of the island, which in 1804 became Haiti. The remainder of the island, by then known as Santo Domingo, sought to gain its own independence in 1821 but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years; it finally attained independence as the Dominican Republic in 1844. In 1861, the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish Empire, but two years later they launched a war that restored independence in 1865. A legacy of unsettled, mostly non-representative rule followed, capped by the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO from 1930-61. Juan BOSCH was elected president in 1962 but was deposed in a military coup in 1963. In 1965, the United States led an intervention in the midst of a civil war sparked by an uprising to restore BOSCH. In 1966, Joaquin BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in an election to become president. BALAGUER maintained a tight grip on power for most of the next 30 years when international reaction to flawed elections forced him to curtail his term in 1996. Since then, regular competitive elections have been held in which opposition candidates have won the presidency. Former President (1996-2000) Leonel FERNANDEZ Reyna won election to a new term in 2004 following a constitutional amendment allowing presidents to serve more than one term, and was since reelected to a second consecutive term.","geo":{"Location":"Caribbean, eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, east of Haiti","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":19,"min":0},"W":{"deg":70,"min":40}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":48670,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":48320,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":350,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than twice the size of New Hampshire","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":360,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Haiti 360 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1288,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"Maritime claims":"measured from claimed archipelagic straight baselines","territorial sea":{"quantity":6,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"rugged highlands and mountains with fertile valleys interspersed","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Lago Enriquillo -46 m","highest point":"Pico Duarte 3,175 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":22.49,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":10.26,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":67.25,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":2750,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":21,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":3.39,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":381,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"lies in the middle of the hurricane belt and subject to severe storms from June to October;

The economy is highly dependent upon the US, the destination for nearly 60% of exports. Remittances from the US amount to about a tenth of GDP, equivalent to almost half of exports and three-quarters of tourism receipts. The country suffers from marked income inequality; the poorest half of the population receives less than one-fifth of GDP, while the richest 10% enjoys nearly 40% of GDP. High unemployment and underemployment remains an important long-term challenge. The Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) came into force in March 2007, boosting investment and exports and reducing losses to the Asian garment industry. The growth of the Dominican Republic's economy rebounded in 2010 from the global recession, and remains one of the fastest growing in the region.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":87250000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":51630000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":11.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":21,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":67.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4498000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":14.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":22.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":63.1,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":14.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":42.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":38.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":49.9,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":15.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":7110000000},"expenditures":{"usd":8634000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":41.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6.3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":18.14,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4734000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":15710000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":21630000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":14020000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":12700000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":118000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":116200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":470000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":470000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-3.862 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":6161000000},"Imports":{"usd":14530000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2705000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":13090000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":19450000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Exchange rates":"Dominican pesos (DOP) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, sugar processing, ferronickel and gold mining, textiles, cement, tobacco"],"agricultureProducts":["sugarcane","coffee","cotton","cocoa","tobacco","rice","beans","potatoes","corn","bananas","cattle","pigs","dairy products","beef","eggs"],"exportCommodities":["ferronickel","sugar","gold","silver","coffee","cocoa","tobacco","meats","consumer goods"],"exportPartners":["US 54.08%","Haiti 9.78%"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","petroleum","cotton and fabrics","chemicals and pharmaceuticals"],"importPartners":["US 42.79%","Venezuela 7.04%","Mexico 6.17%","Colombia 5.59%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":965400,"Telephones - mobile cellular":8630000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"relatively efficient system based on island-wide microwave radio relay network","domestic":"fixed-line teledensity is about 10 per 100 persons;
