{"code":"su","name":"Sudan","region":"Africa","background":"Military regimes favoring Islamic-oriented governments have dominated national politics since independence from the UK in 1956. Sudan was embroiled in two prolonged civil wars during most of the remainder of the 20th century. These conflicts were rooted in northern economic, political, and social domination of largely non-Muslim, non-Arab southern Sudanese. The first civil war ended in 1972 but broke out again in 1983. The second war and famine-related effects resulted in more than four million people displaced and, according to rebel estimates, more than two million deaths over a period of two decades. Peace talks gained momentum in 2002-04 with the signing of several accords. The final North/South Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), signed in January 2005, granted the southern rebels autonomy for six years followed by a referendum on independence for Southern Sudan. The referendum was held in January 2011 and indicated overwhelming support for independence. A separate conflict, which broke out in the western region of Darfur in 2003, has displaced nearly two million people and caused an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 deaths. The UN took command of the Darfur peacekeeping operation from the African Union in December 2007. Peacekeeping troops have struggled to stabilize the situation, which has become increasingly regional in scope and has brought instability to eastern Chad. Sudan also has faced large refugee influxes from neighboring countries primarily Ethiopia and Chad. Armed conflict, poor transport infrastructure, and lack of government support have chronically obstructed the provision of humanitarian assistance to affected populations.","geo":{"Location":"Northern Africa, bordering the Red Sea, between Egypt and Eritrea","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":15,"min":0},"E":{"deg":30,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":2505,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":2376000,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":129813,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than one-quarter the size of the US","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":7687,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Central African Republic 1,165 km, Chad 1,360 km, Democratic Republic of the Congo 628 km, Egypt 1,273 km, Eritrea 605 km, Ethiopia 1,606 km, Kenya 232 km, Libya 383 km, Uganda 435 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":853,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":18,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"generally flat, featureless plain;

A new currency, the Sudanese Pound, was introduced in January 2007 at an initial exchange rate of $1.00 equals 2 Sudanese Pounds. Sudan began exporting crude oil in the last quarter of 1999 and the economy boomed on the back of increases in oil production, high oil prices, and significant inflows of foreign direct investment until the second half of 2008. The Darfur conflict, the aftermath of two decades of civil war in the south, the lack of basic infrastructure in large areas, and a reliance by much of the population on subsistence agriculture ensure much of the population will remain at or below the poverty line for years to come despite rapid rises in average per capita income. Sudan's real GDP expanded by 5.2% during 2010, an improvement over 2009's 4.2% growth but significantly below the more than 10% per year growth experienced prior to the global financial crisis in 2006 and 2007. While the oil sector continues to drive growth, services and utilities play an increasingly important role in the economy with agriculture production remaining important as it employs 80% of the work force and contributes a third of GDP. In the lead up to the referendum on southern secession, which took place in January 2011, Sudan saw its currency depreciate considerably on the black market with the Central Bank's official rate also losing value as the Sudanese people started to hoard foreign currency. The Central Bank of Sudan intervened heavily in the currency market to defend the value of the pound and the Sudanese government introduced a number of measures to restrain excess local demand for hard currency, but uncertainty about the secession has meant that foreign exchange remains in heavy demand.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":100000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":68440000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":32.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":29,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":38.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":11920000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":18.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":11060000000},"expenditures":{"usd":13150000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":94.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":11.8,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":7713000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":13500000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":10150000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":4341000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":3438000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":486700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":84000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":303800,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":11400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":6800000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":84950000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.595 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":9777000000},"Imports":{"usd":8483000000.000001},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2063000000.0000002},"Debt - external":{"usd":37980000000},"Exchange rates":"Sudanese pounds (SDG) per US dollar -","industries":["oil, cotton ginning, textiles, cement, edible oils, sugar, soap distilling, shoes, petroleum refining, pharmaceuticals, armaments, automobile/light truck assembly"],"agricultureProducts":["cotton","groundnuts (peanuts)","sorghum","millet","wheat","gum arabic","sugarcane","cassava (tapioca)","mangos","papaya","bananas","sweet potatoes","sesame","sheep and other livestock"],"exportCommodities":["oil and petroleum products","cotton","sesame","livestock","groundnuts","gum arabic","sugar"],"exportPartners":["China 58.29%","Japan 14.7%","Indonesia 8.83%","India 4.86%"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","manufactured goods","refinery and transport equipment","medicines and chemicals","textiles","wheat"],"importPartners":["China 21.87%","Saudi Arabia 7.22%","Egypt 6.1%","India 5.53%","UAE 5.3%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":370400,"Telephones - mobile cellular":15340000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"well-equipped system by regional standards and being upgraded;
