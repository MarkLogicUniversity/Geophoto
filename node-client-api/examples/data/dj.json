{"code":"dj","name":"Djibouti","region":"Africa","background":"The French Territory of the Afars and the Issas became Djibouti in 1977. Hassan Gouled APTIDON installed an authoritarian one-party state and proceeded to serve as president until 1999. Unrest among the Afars minority during the 1990s led to a civil war that ended in 2001 following the conclusion of a peace accord between Afar rebels and the Issa-dominated government. In 1999, Djibouti's first multi-party presidential elections resulted in the election of Ismail Omar GUELLEH; he was re-elected to a second term in 2005. Djibouti occupies a strategic geographic location at the mouth of the Red Sea and serves as an important transshipment location for goods entering and leaving the east African highlands. The present leadership favors close ties to France, which maintains a significant military presence in the country, but also has strong ties with the US. Djibouti hosts the only US military base in sub-Saharan Africa.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Africa, bordering the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, between Eritrea and Somalia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":11,"min":30},"E":{"deg":43,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":23200,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":23180,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":20,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Massachusetts","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":516,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Eritrea 109 km, Ethiopia 349 km, Somalia 58 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":314,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"coastal plain and plateau separated by central mountains","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Lac Assal -155 m","highest point":"Moussa Ali 2,028 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0.04,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":99.96,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":10,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":0.3,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":0.02,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":25,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"earthquakes;

Two-thirds of Djibouti's inhabitants live in the capital city; the remainder are mostly nomadic herders. Scanty rainfall limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most food must be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling center. Imports and exports from landlocked neighbor Ethiopia represent 70% of port activity at Djibouti's container terminal. Djibouti has few natural resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance development projects. An unemployment rate of nearly 60% in urban areas continues to be a major problem. While inflation is not a concern, due to the fixed tie of the Djiboutian franc to the US dollar, the artificially high value of the Djiboutian franc adversely affects Djibouti's balance of payments. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% between 1999 and 2006 because of recession, civil war, and a high population growth rate (including immigrants and refugees). Djibouti has experienced relatively minimal impact from the global economic downturn, but its reliance on diesel-generated electricity and imported food leave average consumers vulnerable to global price shocks.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":2105000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1140000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":14.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":81.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":351700,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":"NA%"},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":59,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":42,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":30.9,"unit":"%"}},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":135000000},"expenditures":{"usd":182000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA% (31 December 2009 est.)","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":577800000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":940800000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":339000000},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":280000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":260399999.99999997,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":12000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":19.18,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":8476,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-352 million (2009 est.)","Exports":{"usd":100000000},"Imports":{"usd":644000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":428000000},"Exchange rates":"Djiboutian francs (DJF) per US dollar -","industries":["construction, agricultural processing"],"agricultureProducts":["fruits","vegetables","goats","sheep","camels","animal hides"],"exportCommodities":["reexports","hides and skins","coffee (in transit)"],"exportPartners":["Somalia 76.68%","France 4.89%","UAE 4.22%"],"importCommodities":["foods","beverages","transport equipment","chemicals","petroleum products"],"importPartners":["Saudi Arabia 16.26%","India 16.03%","China 14.26%","US 9.57%","Malaysia 6.63%","Japan 4.74%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":16800,"Telephones - mobile cellular":128800,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"telephone facilities in the city of Djibouti are adequate, as are the microwave radio relay connections to outlying areas of the country","domestic":"Djibouti Telecom is the sole provider of telecommunications services and utilizes mostly a microwave radio relay network;
