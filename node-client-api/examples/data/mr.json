{"code":"mr","name":"Mauritania","region":"Africa","background":"Independent from France in 1960, Mauritania annexed the southern third of the former Spanish Sahara (now Western Sahara) in 1976 but relinquished it after three years of raids by the Polisario guerrilla front seeking independence for the territory. Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed TAYA seized power in a coup in 1984 and ruled Mauritania with a heavy hand for more than two decades. A series of presidential elections that he held were widely seen as flawed. A bloodless coup in August 2005 deposed President TAYA and ushered in a military council that oversaw a transition to democratic rule. Independent candidate Sidi Ould Cheikh ABDALLAHI was inaugurated in April 2007 as Mauritania's first freely and fairly elected president. His term ended prematurely in August 2008 when a military junta led by General Mohamed Ould Abdel AZIZ deposed him and ushered in a military council government. AZIZ was subsequently elected president in July 2009 and sworn in the following month. The country continues to experience ethnic tensions among its black population (Afro-Mauritanians) and white and black Moor (Arab-Berber) communities, and is having to confront a growing terrorism threat by al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).","geo":{"Location":"Northern Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Senegal and Western Sahara","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":20,"min":0},"W":{"deg":12,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":1030,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":1030,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than three times the size of New Mexico","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":5074,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Algeria 463 km, Mali 2,237 km, Senegal 813 km, Western Sahara 1,561 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":754,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"mostly barren, flat plains of the Sahara;

Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore, which account for nearly 40% of total exports. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the world but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. Before 2000, drought and economic mismanagement resulted in a buildup of foreign debt. In February 2000, Mauritania qualified for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and nearly all of its foreign debt has since been forgiven. A new investment code approved in December 2001 improved the opportunities for direct foreign investment. Mauritania and the IMF agreed to a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement in 2006. Mauritania made satisfactory progress, but the IMF, World Bank, and other international actors suspended assistance and investment in Mauritania after the August 2008 coup. Since the presidential election in July 2009, donors have resumed assistance. Oil prospects, while initially promising, have largely failed to materialize, and the government has placed a priority on attracting private investment to spur economic growth. The Government also emphasizes reduction of poverty, improvement of health and education, and privatization of the economy.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":6655000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":3799000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":12.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":46.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":40.7,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1318000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":29.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":39,"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":770000000},"expenditures":{"usd":770000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA% (31 December 2009)","Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of domestic credit":"$NA","Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industries":{"Industries":"fish processing, oil production, mining of iron ore, gold, and copper"},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":415300000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":386200000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":16510,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":20000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":30620,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":20610,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":100000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":28320000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-184 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1395000000},"Imports":{"usd":1475000000},"Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"ouguiyas (MRO) per US dollar -","agricultureProducts":["dates","millet","sorghum","rice","corn","cattle","sheep"],"exportCommodities":["iron ore","fish and fish products","gold","copper","petroleum"],"exportPartners":["China 42.06%","Italy 9.71%","Japan 7.57%","Cote d'Ivoire 6.16%","Spain 5.63%","Netherlands 4.32%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","petroleum products","capital goods","foodstuffs","consumer goods"],"importPartners":["France 14.3%","Netherlands 10.33%","China 9.94%","Brazil 5.58%","Belgium 4.87%","Germany 4.04%","Spain 4.02%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":74500,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2182000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"limited system of cable and open-wire lines, minor microwave radio relay links, and radiotelephone communications stations;
