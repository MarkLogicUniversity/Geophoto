{"code":"md","name":"Moldova","region":"Europe","background":"Part of Romania during the interwar period, Moldova was incorporated into the Soviet Union at the close of World War II. Although the country has been independent from the USSR since 1991, Russian forces have remained on Moldovan territory east of the Dniester River supporting the Slavic majority population, mostly Ukrainians and Russians, who have proclaimed a \"Transnistria\" republic. One of the poorest nations in Europe, Moldova became the first former Soviet state to elect a Communist, Vladimir VORONIN, as its president in 2001. VORONIN served as Moldova's president until he resigned in September 2009, following the opposition's gain of a narrow majority in July parliamentary elections and the Communist Party's (PCRM) subsequent inability to attract the three-fifths of parliamentary votes required to elect a president. Moldova's four opposition parties formed a new coalition, the Alliance for European Integration (AIE), which acted as Moldova's governing coalition until December 2010. Moldova experienced significant political uncertainty in 2009 and 2010, holding three general elections (in April 2009, July 2009, and November 2010) and four presidential ballots in parliament, all of which failed to secure a president. Following the November 2010 parliamentary elections, a reconstituted AIE-coalition of three parties formed a government, but remains two votes short of the three-fifths majority required to elect a president. \r\n","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Europe, northeast of Romania","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":47,"min":0},"E":{"deg":29,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":33851,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":32891,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":960,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

It enjoys a favorable climate and good farmland but has no major mineral deposits. As a result, the economy depends heavily on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Moldova must import almost all of its energy supplies. Moldova's dependence on Russian energy was underscored at the end of 2005, when a Russian-owned electrical station in Moldova's separatist Transnistria region cut off power to Moldova and Russia's Gazprom cut off natural gas in disputes over pricing. In January 2009, gas supplies were cut during a dispute between Russia and Ukraine. Russia's decision to ban Moldovan wine and agricultural products, coupled with its decision to double the price Moldova paid for Russian natural gas, have hurt growth. The onset of the global financial crisis and poor economic conditions in Moldova's main foreign markets caused GDP to fall 6% in 2009. Unemployment almost doubled and inflation disappeared - at -0.1%, a record low. Moldova's IMF agreement expired in May 2009. In fall 2009, the IMF allocated $186 million to Moldova to cover its immediate budgetary needs, and the government signed a new agreement with the IMF in January 2010 for a program worth $574 million. In 2010, an upturn in the world economy boosted GDP growth to 6.5% and inflation to 7.3%. Economic reforms have been slow because of corruption and strong political forces backing government controls. Nevertheless, the government's primary goal of EU integration has resulted in some market-oriented progress. The granting of EU trade preferences and increased exports to Russia will encourage higher growth rates, but the agreements are unlikely to serve as a panacea, given the extent to which export success depends on higher quality standards and other factors. The economy has made a modest recovery, but remains vulnerable to political uncertainty, weak administrative capacity, vested bureaucratic interests, higher fuel prices, poor agricultural weather, and the skepticism of foreign investors as well as the presence of an illegal separatist regime in Moldova's Transnistria region.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":10990000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5810000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.9,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":16.3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":63.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1203000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":40.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":43.3,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":26.3,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":28.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":37.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":2164000000},"expenditures":{"usd":2462000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":25,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7.3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":20.54,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1293000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2037999999.9999998},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2097000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":573900000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":3617000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":4370000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":240000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":2931000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":19000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":36.49,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":14230,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":60000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":3176000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":3176000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-565 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1450000000},"Imports":{"usd":3660000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1710000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":4618000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":2649000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":62440000},"Exchange rates":"Moldovan lei (MDL) per US dollar -","industries":["sugar, vegetable oil, food processing, agricultural machinery","foundry equipment, refrigerators and freezers, washing machines","hosiery, shoes, textiles"],"agricultureProducts":["vegetables","fruits","grapes","grain","sugar beets","sunflower seed","tobacco","beef","milk","wine"],"exportCommodities":["foodstuffs","textiles","machinery"],"exportPartners":["Russia 23.77%","Italy 14.11%","Romania 12.74%","Germany 6.92%","Turkey 6.08%","Belarus 5.38%"],"importCommodities":["mineral products and fuel","machinery and equipment","chemicals","textiles"],"importPartners":["Ukraine 19.9%","Romania 15.1%","Russia 14.52%","Germany 8.69%","Italy 5.7%","Belarus 4.38%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1139000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2785000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"poor service outside Chisinau;
