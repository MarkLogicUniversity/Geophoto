{"code":"ae","name":"United Arab Emirates","region":"Middle East","background":"The Trucial States of the Persian Gulf coast granted the UK control of their defense and foreign affairs in 19th century treaties. In 1971, six of these states - Abu Zaby, 'Ajman, Al Fujayrah, Ash Shariqah, Dubayy, and Umm al Qaywayn - merged to form the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They were joined in 1972 by Ra's al Khaymah. The UAE's per capita GDP is on par with those of leading West European nations. Its generosity with oil revenues and its moderate foreign policy stance have allowed the UAE to play a vital role in the affairs of the region. For more than three decades, oil and global finance drove the UAE's economy. However, in 2008-09, the confluence of falling oil prices, collapsing real estate prices, and the international banking crisis hit the UAE especially hard. In March 2011, about 100 Emirati activists and intellectuals posted on the Internet and sent to the government a petition calling for greater political reform, including the establishment of a parliament with full legislative powers and the further expansion of the electorate and the rights of the Federal National Council, the UAE's quasi-legislature. In April 2011, the Emirati Government arrested four activists - all of whom signed the petition - for their alleged criticisms of the UAE system of government.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, bordering the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, between Oman and Saudi Arabia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":24,"min":0},"E":{"deg":54,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":83600,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":83600,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Maine","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":867,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Oman 410 km, Saudi Arabia 457 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1318,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"flat, barren coastal plain merging into rolling sand dunes of vast desert wasteland;

Successful efforts at economic diversification have reduced the portion of GDP based on oil and gas output to 25%. Since the discovery of oil in the UAE more than 30 years ago, the UAE has undergone a profound transformation from an impoverished region of small desert principalities to a modern state with a high standard of living. The government has increased spending on job creation and infrastructure expansion and is opening up utilities to greater private sector involvement. In April 2004, the UAE signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with Washington and in November 2004 agreed to undertake negotiations toward a Free Trade Agreement with the US, however, those talks have not moved forward. The country's Free Trade Zones - offering 100% foreign ownership and zero taxes - are helping to attract foreign investors. The global financial crisis, tight international credit, and deflated asset prices constricted the economy in 2009 and 2010. UAE authorities tried to blunt the crisis by increasing spending and boosting liquidity in the banking sector. The crisis hit Dubai hardest, as it was heavily exposed to depressed real estate prices. Dubai lacked sufficient cash to meet its debt obligations, prompting global concern about its solvency. The UAE Central Bank and Abu Dhabi-based banks bought the largest shares. In December 2009 Dubai received an additional $10 billion loan from the emirate of Abu Dhabi. The economy is expected to continue a slow rebound. Dependence on oil, a large expatriate workforce, and growing inflation pressures are significant long-term challenges. The UAE's strategic plan for the next few years focuses on diversification and creating more opportunities for nationals through improved education and increased private sector employment.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":246800000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":301900000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":51.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":47.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":3908000,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":78,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":19.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":26.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":65019999999.99999},"expenditures":{"usd":60020000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":44.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":68760000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":228500000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":290000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":109600000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":71540000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":65980000000.00001,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":2798000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":435000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2700000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":192900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":97800000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":50240000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":59420000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":7567000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":16750000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":6071000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":3409000000},"Exports":{"usd":195800000000},"Imports":{"usd":159000000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":39100000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":122700000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":76380000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":54910000000},"Exchange rates":"Emirati dirhams (AED) per US dollar -","industries":["petroleum and petrochemicals","fishing, aluminum, cement, fertilizers, commercial ship repair, construction materials, some boat building, handicrafts, textiles"],"agricultureProducts":["dates","vegetables","watermelons","poultry","eggs","dairy products","fish"],"exportCommodities":["crude oil 45%","natural gas","reexports","dried fish","dates"],"exportPartners":["Japan 17.27%","South Korea 10.49%","India 9.96%","Iran 6.82%","Thailand 5.11%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","chemicals","food"],"importPartners":["China 15.03%","India 14.27%","US 8.44%","Germany 5.81%","Japan 4.52%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1561000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":10672000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern fiber-optic integrated services;
