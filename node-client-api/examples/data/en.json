Estonia's successive governments have pursued a free market, pro-business economic agenda and have wavered little in their commitment to pro-market reforms. The current government has followed relatively sound fiscal policies that have resulted in balanced budgets and very low public debt. The economy benefits from strong electronics and telecommunications sectors and strong trade ties with Finland, Sweden, and Germany. Tallinn's priority has been to sustain high growth rates - on average 8% per year from 2003 to 2007. Estonia's economy slowed down markedly and fell sharply into recession in mid-2008, primarily as a result of an investment and consumption slump following the bursting of the real estate market bubble. GDP dropped nearly 14% in 2009, among the world's highest rates of contraction. Rising exports to Sweden and Finland lead an economic recovery in 2010, but unemployment stands above 17%. Estonia joined the OECD in December 2010 and adopted the euro in January 2011.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":24690000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":19780000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":28.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":68.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":688000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":22.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":74.5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":17.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":19.7,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":27.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":31.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":7851000000},"expenditures":{"usd":8210000000.000001}},"Public debt":{"quantity":7.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":9.39,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":5345000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":10700000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":18940000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":2654000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":8779000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":7080000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":2943000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":3025000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":7600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":30000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":7280,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":30590,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":1020000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1020000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":265000000},"Exports":{"usd":11500000000},"Imports":{"usd":12170000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3641000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":25130000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":17530000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":7134000000},"Exchange rates":"kroon (EEK) per US dollar -","industries":["engineering, electronics, wood and wood products, textiles","information technology, telecommunications"],"agricultureProducts":["grain","potatoes","vegetables","livestock and dairy products","fish"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and electrical equipment 21%","wood and wood products 9%","metals 9%","furniture 7%","vehicles and parts 5%","food products and beverages 4%","textiles 4%","plastics 3%"],"exportPartners":["Finland 18.57%","Sweden 12.52%","Latvia 9.51%","Russia 9.33%","Germany 6.09%","Lithuania 4.76%","US 4.26%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and electrical equipment 22%","mineral fuels 18%","chemical products 3%","foodstuffs 6%","plastics 6%","textiles 5%"],"importPartners":["Finland 14.52%","Lithuania 10.84%","Latvia 10.47%","Germany 10.33%","Russia 8.59%","Sweden 8.34%","Poland 5.63%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":492800,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2720000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"foreign investment in the form of joint business ventures greatly improved telephone service with a wide range of high quality voice, data, and Internet services available","domestic":"substantial fiber-optic cable systems carry telephone, TV, and radio traffic in the digital mode;
