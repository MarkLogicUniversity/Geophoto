{"code":"ts","name":"Tunisia","region":"Africa","background":"Rivalry between French and Italian interests in Tunisia culminated in a French invasion in 1881 and the creation of a protectorate. Agitation for independence in the decades following World War I was finally successful in getting the French to recognize Tunisia as an independent state in 1956. The country's first president, Habib BOURGUIBA, established a strict one-party state. He dominated the country for 31 years, repressing Islamic fundamentalism and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation. In November 1987, BOURGUIBA was removed from office and replaced by Zine el Abidine BEN ALI in a bloodless coup. Street protests that began in Tunis in December 2010 over high unemployment, corruption, widespread poverty, and high food prices escalated in January 2011, culminating in rioting that led to hundreds of deaths. On 14 January 2011, the same day BEN ALI dismissed the government, he fled the country, and by late January 2011, Prime Minister Mohamed GHANNOUCHI announced the formation of a \"national unity government\" with the head of the Chamber of Deputies, Fouad M'BAZAA, as the interim president.","geo":{"Location":"Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Algeria and Libya","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":34,"min":0},"E":{"deg":9,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":163610,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":155360,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":8250,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Georgia","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1424,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Algeria 965 km, Libya 459 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1148,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"mountains in north;

Governmental control of economic affairs while still heavy has gradually lessened over the past decade with increasing privatization, simplification of the tax structure, and a prudent approach to debt. Progressive social policies also have helped raise living conditions in Tunisia relative to the region. Real growth, which averaged almost 5% over the past decade, declined to 4.6% in 2008 and to 3-4% in 2009-10 because of economic contraction and slowing of import demand in Europe - Tunisia's largest export market. However, development of non-textile manufacturing, a recovery in agricultural production, and strong growth in the services sector somewhat mitigated the economic effect of slowing exports. Tunisia will need to reach even higher growth levels to create sufficient employment opportunities for an already large number of unemployed as well as the growing population of university graduates. The challenges ahead include: privatizing industry, liberalizing the investment code to increase foreign investment, improving government efficiency, reducing the trade deficit, and reducing socioeconomic disparities in the impoverished south and west.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":100000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":44290000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":10.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":34.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":54.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3830000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":18.3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":31.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":49.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":31.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":40,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":26.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":9806000000},"expenditures":{"usd":11760000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":49.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":11490000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":29390000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":31100000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":9120000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":11080000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":11800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":130000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":145000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":91380,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":89000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":77130,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":87300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":425000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":2970000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":4219999999.9999995,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1250000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":65129999999.99999,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.389 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":16110000000},"Imports":{"usd":20020000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":11230000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":18760000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":33560000000.000004},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":251000000},"Exchange rates":"Tunisian dinars (TND) per US dollar -","industries":["petroleum, mining (particularly phosphate and iron ore), tourism, textiles, footwear, agribusiness, beverages"],"agricultureProducts":["olives","olive oil","grain","tomatoes","citrus fruit","sugar beets","dates","almonds","beef","dairy products"],"exportCommodities":["clothing","semi-finished goods and textiles","agricultural products","mechanical goods","phosphates and chemicals","hydrocarbons","electrical equipment"],"exportPartners":["France 29.6%","Italy 21%","Germany 8.8%","Libya 5.8%","Spain 5%","UK 4.8% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["textiles","machinery and equipment","hydrocarbons","chemicals","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["France 20.1%","Italy 16.4%","Germany 8.8%","China 5%","Spain 4.5%","US 4% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1279000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":9754000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"above the African average and continuing to be upgraded;
