{"code":"nl","name":"Netherlands","region":"Europe","background":"The Dutch United Provinces declared their independence from Spain in 1579; during the 17th century, they became a leading seafaring and commercial power, with settlements and colonies around the world. After a 20-year French occupation, a Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed in 1815. In 1830 Belgium seceded and formed a separate kingdom. The Netherlands remained neutral in World War I, but suffered invasion and occupation by Germany in World War II. A modern, industrialized nation, the Netherlands is also a large exporter of agricultural products. The country was a founding member of NATO and the EEC (now the EU), and participated in the introduction of the euro in 1999. In October 2010, the former Netherlands Antilles was dissolved and the three smallest islands - Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba - became special municipalities in the Netherlands administrative structure. The larger islands of Sint Maarten and Curacao joined the Netherlands and Aruba as constituent countries forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands.","geo":{"Location":"Western Europe, bordering the North Sea, between Belgium and Germany","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":52,"min":30},"E":{"deg":5,"min":45}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":41543,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":33893,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":7650,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than twice the size of New Jersey","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1027,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Belgium 450 km, Germany 577 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":451,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive fishing zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"mostly coastal lowland and reclaimed land (polders);

Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing, chemicals, petroleum refining, and electrical machinery. A highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2% of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports. The Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU partners, began circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002. The country has been one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the US. After 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth, the Netherlands' economy - which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services - was hard-hit by global economic crisis. Dutch GDP contracted 3.9% in 2009, while exports declined nearly 25% due to a sharp contraction in world demand. The Dutch financial sector has also suffered, due in part to the high exposure of some Dutch banks to U.S. mortgage-backed securities. In response to turmoil in financial markets, the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third, to prevent further systemic risk. The government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs, offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers, and expanding export credit facilities. The stimulus programs and bank bailouts, however, resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6% of GDP in 2009 and 5.6% in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7% of GDP in 2008. With unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption, the government of Prime Minister Mark RUTTE is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":676900000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":783300000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":72.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":7860000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":10.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":22.9,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":30.9,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":356000000000},"expenditures":{"usd":399300000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":64.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.01,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":368100000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1124000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2083000000000.0002},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":542500000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":108200000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":124100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":10560000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":15450000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":57190,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":922800,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1660000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2426000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":100000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":79580000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":48600000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":55590000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":24600000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1416000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":46690000000},"Exports":{"usd":451300000000},"Imports":{"usd":408400000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":"$NA (30 June 2010)","Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":687800000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":950800000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["agroindustries, metal and engineering products, electrical machinery and equipment, chemicals, petroleum, construction, microelectronics, fishing"],"agricultureProducts":["grains","potatoes","sugar beets","fruits","vegetables","livestock"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and equipment","chemicals","fuels","foodstuffs"],"exportPartners":["Germany 25.54%","Belgium 12.49%","France 9.27%","UK 8.17%","Italy 5.07%","US 3.97%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","chemicals","fuels","foodstuffs","clothing"],"importPartners":["Germany 17.16%","China 11.58%","Belgium 8.68%","US 7.77%","UK 5.72%","Russia 4.47%","France 4.4%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":7320000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":21182000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"highly developed and well maintained","domestic":"extensive fixed-line fiber-optic network;
