{"code":"lo","name":"Slovakia","region":"Europe","background":"Slovakia's roots can be traced to the 9th century state of Great Moravia. Subsequently, the Slovaks became part of the Hungarian Kingdom, where they remained for the next 1,000 years. Following the formation of the dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1867, language and education policies favoring the use of Hungarian (Magyarization) resulted in a strengthening of Slovak nationalism and a cultivation of cultural ties with the closely related Czechs, who were themselves ruled by the Austrians. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the close of World War I, the Slovaks joined the Czechs to form Czechoslovakia. Following the chaos of World War II, Czechoslovakia became a Communist nation within Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe. Soviet influence collapsed in 1989 and Czechoslovakia once more became free. The Slovaks and the Czechs agreed to separate peacefully on 1 January 1993. Slovakia joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004 and the euro area on 1 January 2009.","geo":{"Location":"Central Europe, south of Poland","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":48,"min":40},"E":{"deg":19,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":49035,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":48105,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":930,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

Reforms to the taxation, healthcare, pension, and social welfare systems helped Slovakia consolidate its budget and get on track to join the EU in 2004 and to adopt the euro in January 2009. Major privatizations are nearly complete, the banking sector is almost entirely in foreign hands, and the government has helped facilitate a foreign investment boom with business friendly policies. Slovakia's economic growth exceeded expectations in 2001-08 despite a general European slowdown. Unemployment, at an unacceptable 18% in 2003-04, dropped to 7.7% in 2008 but remains the economy's Achilles heel. Foreign direct investment (FDI) accounted for much of the growth until 2008. Cheap and skilled labor, low taxes, a 19% flat tax for corporations and individuals, no dividend taxes, a relatively liberal labor code and a favorable geographical location are Slovakia's main advantages for foreign investors. Foreign investment in the automotive and electronic sectors has been especially strong. To maintain a stable operating environment for investors, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development advised the Slovak government to refrain from intervening in important sectors of the economy. However, Bratislava's approach to mitigating the economic slowdown has included substantial government intervention and the option to nationalize strategic companies. RADICOVA's government, in power since July 2010, has allowed the budget deficit to rise slightly, to 7.4% of GDP in 2010. GDP fell nearly 5% in 2009 before gaining back 4% in 2010, and unemployment rose above 12% in 2010, as the global recession impacted many segments of the economy.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":120200000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":87450000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":35.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":61.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2673000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":27,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":69.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":13.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":21,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":20.9,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":28450000000},"expenditures":{"usd":35010000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":41,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":34370000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":52630000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":65090000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":4672000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":25900000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":28750000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":8891000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":9412000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":4114,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":79930,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":75110,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":144000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":9000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":103000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":6493000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":15000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":6974000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":14160000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.93 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":64180000000.00001},"Imports":{"usd":62430000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1160000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":59330000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":52200000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":2643000000},"Exchange rates":"Slovak koruny (SKK) per US dollar -","industries":["metal and metal products","food and beverages","electricity, gas, coke, oil, nuclear fuel","chemicals and manmade fibers","machinery","paper and printing","earthenware and ceramics","transport vehicles","textiles","electrical and optical apparatus","rubber products"],"agricultureProducts":["grains","potatoes","sugar beets","hops","fruit","pigs","cattle","poultry","forest products"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and electrical equipment 35.9%","vehicles 21%","base metals 11.3%","chemicals and minerals 8.1%","plastics 4.9% (2009 est.)"],"exportPartners":["Germany 20.1%","Czech Republic 12.9%","France 7.8%","Poland 7.2%","Hungary 6.3%","Italy 6.1%","Austria 5.8%","UK 4.8% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment 31%","mineral products 13%","vehicles 12%","base metals 9%","chemicals 8%","plastics 6% (2009 est.)"],"importPartners":["Germany 16.8%","Czech Republic 12.3%","Russia 9%","South Korea 6.8%","China 5.8%","Hungary 5.3%","Poland 4% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1022000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":5498000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"Slovakia has a modern telecommunications system that has expanded dramatically in recent years with the growth in cellular services","domestic":"analog system is now receiving digital equipment and is being enlarged with fiber-optic cable, especially in the larger cities;
