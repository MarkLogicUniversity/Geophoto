{"code":"bt","name":"Bhutan","region":"South Asia","background":"In 1865, Britain and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu, under which Bhutan would receive an annual subsidy in exchange for ceding some border land to British India. Under British influence, a monarchy was set up in 1907; three years later, a treaty was signed whereby the British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal affairs and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs. This role was assumed by independent India after 1947. Two years later, a formal Indo-Bhutanese accord returned the areas of Bhutan annexed by the British, formalized the annual subsidies the country received, and defined India's responsibilities in defense and foreign relations. A refugee issue of over 100,000 Bhutanese in Nepal remains unresolved; 90% of the refugees are housed in seven United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) camps. In March 2005, King Jigme Singye WANGCHUCK unveiled the government's draft constitution - which would introduce major democratic reforms - and pledged to hold a national referendum for its approval. In December 2006, the King abdicated the throne to his son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel WANGCHUCK, in order to give him experience as head of state before the democratic transition. In early 2007, India and Bhutan renegotiated their treaty to allow Bhutan greater autonomy in conducting its foreign policy, although Thimphu continues to coordinate policy decisions in this area with New Delhi. In July 2007, seven ministers of Bhutan's 10-member cabinet resigned to join the political process, and the cabinet acted as a caretaker regime until democratic elections for seats to the country's first parliament were completed in March 2008. The king ratified the country's first constitution in July 2008.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Asia, between China and India","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":27,"min":30},"E":{"deg":90,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":38394,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":38394,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"about one-half the size of Indiana","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1075,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"China 470 km, India 605 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"mostly mountainous with some fertile valleys and savanna","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Drangeme Chhu 97 m","highest point":"Gangkar Puensum 7,570 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.43,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":97.27,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":400,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":95,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":0.43,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":199,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"violent storms from the Himalayas are the source of the country's name, which translates as Land of the Thunder Dragon;

Agriculture consists largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary links and dependence on India's financial assistance. The industrial sector is technologically backward, with most production of the cottage industry type. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Model education, social, and environment programs are underway with support from multilateral development organizations. Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. For example, the government, in its cautious expansion of the tourist sector, encourages visits by upscale, environmentally conscientious tourists. Complicated controls and uncertain policies in areas such as industrial licensing, trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment. Hydropower exports to India have boosted Bhutan's overall growth. New hydropower projects will be the driving force behind Bhutan's ability to create employment and sustain growth in the coming years.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":3875000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1412000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":17.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":45,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":37.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":299900,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":43.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":39.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":17.2,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":23.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":37.6,"unit":"%"}},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":302000000},"expenditures":{"usd":588000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":57.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":335000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":647600000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":169900000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":1480000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":184000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":1296000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1250,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":164000000},"Exports":{"usd":513000000},"Imports":{"usd":533000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":836000000},"Exchange rates":"ngultrum (BTN) per US dollar -","industries":["cement, wood products, processed fruits, alcoholic beverages, calcium carbide, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["rice","corn","root crops","citrus","foodgrains","dairy products","eggs"],"exportCommodities":["electricity (to India)","ferrosilicon","cement","calcium carbide","copper wire","manganese","vegetable oil"],"exportPartners":["India 86.3%","Bangladesh 8.1%","Italy 1.5%"],"importCommodities":["fuel and lubricants","passenger cars","machinery and parts","fabrics","rice"],"importPartners":["India 63%","Japan 12.3%","China 5.1%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":26300,"Telephones - mobile cellular":327100,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"urban towns and district headquarters have telecommunications services","domestic":"low teledensity;
