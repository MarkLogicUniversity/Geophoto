{"code":"ku","name":"Kuwait","region":"Middle East","background":"Britain oversaw foreign relations and defense for the ruling Kuwaiti AL-SABAH dynasty from 1899 until independence in 1961. Kuwait was attacked and overrun by Iraq on 2 August 1990. Following several weeks of aerial bombardment, a US-led, UN coalition began a ground assault on 23 February 1991 that liberated Kuwait in four days. Kuwait spent more than $5 billion to repair oil infrastructure damaged during 1990-91. The AL-SABAH family has ruled since returning to power in 1991 and reestablished an elected legislature that in recent years has become increasingly assertive. The country witnessed the historic election in May 2009 of four women to its National Assembly. Amid the 2010-11 uprisings and protests across the Arab world, stateless Arabs, known as bidoon, staged small protests in February and March 2011 demanding citizenship, jobs, and other benefits available to Kuwaiti nationals. Youth activist groups - supported by opposition legislators and the prime minister's rivals within the ruling family - in March of 2011 rallied for an end to corruption and the prime minister's ouster.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, bordering the Persian Gulf, between Iraq and Saudi Arabia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":29,"min":30},"E":{"deg":45,"min":45}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":17818,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":17818,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than New Jersey","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":462,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Iraq 240 km, Saudi Arabia 222 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":499,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"flat to slightly undulating desert plain","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Persian Gulf 0 m","highest point":"unnamed elevation 306 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0.84,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.17,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":98.99,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":100,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":0.02,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":0.44,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":164,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"sudden cloudbursts are common from October to April and bring heavy rain, which can damage roads and houses;

Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 95% of export revenues, and 95% of government income. Kuwaiti officials have committed to increasing oil production to 4 million barrels per day by 2020. The rise in global oil prices throughout 2010 is reviving government consumption and economic growth as Kuwait experiences a 20% increase in government budget revenue. Kuwait has done little to diversify its economy, in part, because of this positive fiscal situation, and, in part, due to the poor business climate and the acrimonious relationship between the National Assembly and the executive branch, which has stymied most movement on economic reforms. Nonetheless, the government in May 2010 passed a privatization bill that allows the government to sell assets to private investors, and in January passed an economic development plan that pledges to spend up to $130 billion in five years to diversify the economy away from oil, attract more investment, and boost private sector participation in the economy. Increasing government expenditures by so large an amount during the planned time frame may be difficult to accomplish.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":136500000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":131300000000.00002},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":48.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":51.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":2154000,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":"NA%"},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":13.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":64810000000},"expenditures":{"usd":38120000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":12.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.9,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":18120000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":88710000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":96710000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":95940000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":45830000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":40210000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":2494000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":320000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2349000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":104000000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":12700000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":12700000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":"300 million cu m (2009 est.)
