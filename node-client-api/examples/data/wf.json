Notably, Wallis and Futuna was the only French colony to side with the Vichy regime during World War II, a phase that ended in May of 1942 with the arrival of 2,000 American troops. In 1959, the inhabitants of the islands voted to become a French overseas territory and officially assumed this status in July 1961.","geo":{"Location":"Oceania, islands in the South Pacific Ocean, about two-thirds of the way from Hawaii to New Zealand","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":13,"min":18},"W":{"deg":176,"min":12}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":142,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":142,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"1.5 times the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":129,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"volcanic origin;
