{"code":"gm","name":"Germany","region":"Europe","background":"As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation (after Russia), Germany is a key member of the continent's economic, political, and defense organizations. European power struggles immersed Germany in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War, two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key Western economic and security organizations, the EC, which became the EU, and NATO, while the Communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990. Since then, Germany has expended considerable funds to bring Eastern productivity and wages up to Western standards. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European exchange currency, the euro. In January 2011, Germany assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011-12 term.","geo":{"Location":"Central Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, between the Netherlands and Poland, south of Denmark","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":51,"min":0},"E":{"deg":9,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":357022,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":348672,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":8350,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Montana","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":3621,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Austria 784 km, Belgium 167 km, Czech Republic 646 km, Denmark 68 km, France 451 km, Luxembourg 138 km, Netherlands 577 km, Poland 456 km, Switzerland 334 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2389,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"lowlands in north, uplands in center, Bavarian Alps in south","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Neuendorf bei Wilster -3.54 m","highest point":"Zugspitze 2,963 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":33.13,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.6,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":66.27,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":4850,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":188,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":38.01,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":460,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"flooding","internationalEnvironmentAgreements":{"signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements","partyTo":["Air Pollution","Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides","Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants","Air Pollution-Sulfur 85","Air Pollution-Sulfur 94","Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds","Antarctic-Environmental Protocol","Antarctic-Marine Living Resources","Antarctic Seals","Antarctic Treaty","Biodiversity","Climate Change","Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol","Desertification","Endangered Species","Environmental Modification","Hazardous Wastes","Law of the Sea","Marine Dumping","Ozone Layer Protection","Ship Pollution","Tropical Timber 83","Tropical Timber 94","Wetlands","Whaling"]},"naturalResources":["coal","lignite","natural gas","iron ore","copper","nickel","uranium","potash","salt","construction materials","timber","arable land"],"environmentalIssues":["emissions from coal-burning utilities and industries contribute to air pollution","acid rain, resulting from sulfur dioxide emissions, is damaging forests","pollution in the Baltic Sea from raw sewage and industrial effluents from rivers in eastern Germany","hazardous waste disposal","government established a mechanism for ending the use of nuclear power over the next 15 years","government working to meet EU commitment to identify nature preservation areas in line with the EU's Flora, Fauna, and Habitat directive"],"climate":["temperate and marine","cool, cloudy, wet winters and summers","occasional warm mountain (foehn) wind"],"geographyNote":["strategic location on North European Plain and along the entrance to the Baltic Sea"]},"people":{"Population":81471,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":13.3,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":66.1,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"20.6% (male 7,217,163/female 9,557,634) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":44.9,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":43.7,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":46,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":"-0.208% (2011 est.)","Birth rate":{"quantity":8.3,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":10.92,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":{"quantity":0.54,"unit":"migrant(s)/1,000 population"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":74,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":0,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Major cities - population":"BERLIN (capital) 3.438 million;

Like its western European neighbors, Germany faces significant demographic challenges to sustained long-term growth. Low fertility rates and declining net immigration are increasing pressure on the country's social welfare system and necessitate structural reforms. The modernization and integration of the eastern German economy - where unemployment can exceed 20% in some municipalities - continues to be a costly long-term process, with annual transfers from west to east amounting in 2008 alone to roughly $12 billion. Reforms launched by the government of Chancellor Gerhard SCHROEDER (1998-2005), deemed necessary to address chronically high unemployment and low average growth, contributed to strong growth in 2006 and 2007 and falling unemployment. These advances, as well as a government subsidized, reduced working hour scheme, help explain the relatively modest increase in unemployment during the 2008-09 recession - the deepest since World War II - and its decrease to 7.4%in 2010. GDP contracted 4.7% in 2009 but grew by 3.6% in 2010. In its annual projection for 2011, the Federal Government expects the upswing to continue, with GDP forecast to grow this year at a real rate of 2.3%. The recovery was attributable primarily to rebounding manufacturing orders and exports - increasingly outside the Euro Zone. Domestic demand, however, is becoming more significant driver of Germany's economic expansion. Stimulus and stabilization efforts initiated in 2008 and 2009 and tax cuts introduced in Chancellor Angela MERKEL's second term increased Germany's budget deficit to 3.5% in 2010. The Bundesbank expects the deficit to drop to about 2.5% in 2011, below the EU's 3% limit. A constitutional amendment approved in 2009 likewise limits the federal government to structural deficits of no more than 0.35% of GDP per annum as of 2016.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":2940000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":3316000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":27.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":71.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":43350000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":29.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":67.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.4,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":15.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":27,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1396000000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1516000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":78.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":4.96,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1627000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4288000000000.0005},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":5200000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1298000000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":593400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":547299999999.99994,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":61700000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":41670000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":156800,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2437000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":536600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2862000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":276000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":15290000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":96260000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":12640000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":94570000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":175600000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":162300000000},"Exports":{"usd":1337000000000},"Imports":{"usd":1120000000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":4713000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":1057000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1484000000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["among the world's largest and most technologically advanced producers of iron, steel, coal, cement, chemicals, machinery, vehicles, machine tools, electronics, food and beverages, shipbuilding, textiles"],"agricultureProducts":["potatoes","wheat","barley","sugar beets","fruit","cabbages","cattle","pigs","poultry"],"exportCommodities":["machinery","vehicles","chemicals","metals and manufactures","foodstuffs","textiles"],"exportPartners":["France 10.2%","US 6.7%","Netherlands 6.7%","UK 6.6%","Italy 6.3%","Austria 6%","China 4.5%","Switzerland 4.4% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["machinery","vehicles","chemicals","foodstuffs","textiles","metals"],"importPartners":["Netherlands 8.5%","China 8.2%","France 8.2%","US 5.9%","Italy 5.9%","UK 4.9%","Belgium 4.3%","Austria 4.3%","Switzerland 4.2% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":48700000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":105000000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"Germany has one of the world's most technologically advanced telecommunications systems;
