{"code":"bv","name":"Bouvet Island","region":"Antarctica","background":"This uninhabited volcanic island is almost entirely covered by glaciers and is difficult to approach. It was discovered in 1739 by a French naval officer after whom the island was named. No claim was made until 1825, when the British flag was raised. In 1928, the UK waived its claim in favor of Norway, which had occupied the island the previous year. In 1971, Norway designated Bouvet Island and the adjacent territorial waters a nature reserve. Since 1977, it has run an automated meteorological station on the island.","geo":{"Location":"island in the South Atlantic Ocean, southwest of the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa)","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":54,"min":26},"E":{"deg":3,"min":24}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":49,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":49,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"about 0.3 times the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":29.6,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":4,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"volcanic; coast is mostly inaccessible","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"South Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Olav Peak 935 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":"100% (93% ice) (2005)"},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"},"Natural hazards":"NA","naturalResources":["none"],"environmentalIssues":["NA"],"climate":["antarctic"],"geographyNote":["covered by glacial ice","declared a nature reserve by Norway"]},"people":{"Population":"uninhabited"},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"none","conventional short form":"Bouvet Island"},"Dependency status":"territory of Norway; administered by the Polar Department of the Ministry of Justice and Oslo Police","Legal system":"the laws of Norway, where applicable, apply","Flag description":"the flag of Norway is used"},"economy":{"Economy - overview":"no economic activity; declared a nature reserve"},"communications":{"Internet country code":".bv","Internet hosts":6,"Communications - note":"automatic meteorological station"},"transport":{"Ports and terminals":"none; offshore anchorage only"},"military":{"Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of Norway"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
