{"code":"tb","name":"Saint Barthelemy","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Discovered in 1493 by Christopher COLUMBUS who named it for his brother Bartolomeo, Saint Barthelemy was first settled by the French in 1648. In 1784, the French sold the island to Sweden, who renamed the largest town Gustavia, after the Swedish King GUSTAV III, and made it a free port; the island prospered as a trade and supply center during the colonial wars of the 18th century. France repurchased the island in 1878 and placed it under the administration of Guadeloupe. Saint Barthelemy retained its free port status along with various Swedish appellations such as Swedish street and town names, and the three-crown symbol on the coat of arms. In 2003, the populace of the island voted to secede from Guadeloupe and in 2007, the island became a French overseas collectivity.","geo":{"Location":"Caribbean, island between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean; located in the Leeward Islands (northern) group; Saint Barthelemy lies east of the US Virgin Islands","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":17,"min":90},"W":{"deg":62,"min":85}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"quantity":21,"unit":"sq km"},"Area - comparative":"less than an eighth of the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Terrain":"hilly, almost completely surrounded by shallow-water reefs, with plentiful beaches","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caribbean Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Morne du Vitet 286 m"},"naturalResources":["has few natural resources","its beaches being the most important"],"environmentalIssues":["with no natural rivers or streams, fresh water is in short supply, especially in summer, and provided by desalinization of sea water, collection of rain water, or imported via water tanker"],"climate":["tropical, with practically no variation in temperature","has two seasons (dry and humid)"]},"people":{"Population":7367,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":18.8,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":69.5,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"11.7% (male 428/female 431) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":40.4,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":40.6,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":40.3,"unit":"years"}},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":{"quantity":1.027,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years":{"quantity":1.06,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":1.19,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over":{"quantity":0.98,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population":{"quantity":1.14,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":"NA","Education expenditures":"NA","ethnicGroups":["white","Creole (mulatto)","black","Guadeloupe Mestizo (French-East Asia)"],"religions":["Roman Catholic","Protestant","Jehovah's Witness"],"languages":["French (primary)","English"]},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"Overseas Collectivity of Saint Barthelemy","conventional short form":"Saint Barthelemy","local long form":"Collectivite d'outre mer de Saint-Barthelemy","local short form":"Saint-Barthelemy"},"Dependency status":"overseas collectivity of France","Capital":{"name":"Gustavia","geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":17,"min":53},"W":{"deg":62,"min":51}},"time difference":"UTC-4 (1 hour ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time)"},"Independence":"none (overseas collectivity of France)","National holiday":"Bastille Day, 14 July (1789); note - local holiday is St. Barthelemy Day, 24 August","Legal system":"French civil law","Suffrage":"18 years of age, universal","Executive branch":{"chief of state":"President Nicolas SARKOZY (since 16 May 2007), represented by Prefect Dominique LACROIX (since 21 March 2007)","head of government":"President of the Territorial Council Bruno MAGRAS (since 16 July 2007)","cabinet":"Executive Council; note - there is also an advisory, economic, social, and cultural council","elections":"French president elected by popular vote for a five-year term; prefect appointed by the French president on the advice of the French Ministry of Interior; president of the Territorial Council elected by the members of the Council for a five-year term","election results":"Bruno MAGRAS unanimously elected president by the Territorial Council on 16 July 2007"},"Legislative branch":{"Legislative branch":"unicameral Territorial Council (19 seats; members elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms)","elections":"last held on 1 and 8 July 2007 (next to be held in July 2012)","election results":"percent of vote by party - SBA 72.2%, Action-Equilibre-Transparence 9.9%, Ensemble pour Saint-Barthelemy 7.9%, Tous Unis pour Saint-Barthelemy 9.9%; seats by party - SBA 16, Action-Equilibre-Transparence 1, Ensemble pour Saint-Barthelemy 1, Tous Unis pour Saint-Barthelemy 1"},"Political parties and leaders":"Action-Equilibre-Transparence [Maxime DESOUCHES]; Ensemble pour Saint-Barthelemy [Benoit CHAUVIN]; Saint-Barth d'Abord! or SBA [Bruno MAGRAS]; Tous Unis pour Saint-Barthelemy [Karine MIOT-RICHARD]","Political pressure groups and leaders":"The Marine Reserve (protection of fish); Rotary Club","Diplomatic representation in the US":"none (overseas collectivity of France)","Diplomatic representation from the US":"none (overseas collectivity of France)","Flag description":"the flag of France is used","National anthem":{"name":"\"L'Hymne a St. Barthelemy\" (Hymn to St. Barthelemy)","lyrics/music":"Isabelle Massart DERAVIN/Michael VALENTI"},"internationalOrganizations":["UPU"]},"economy":{"Economy - overview":"The economy of Saint Barthelemy is based upon high-end tourism and duty-free luxury commerce, serving visitors primarily from North America.
