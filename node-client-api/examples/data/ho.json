After two and a half decades of mostly military rule, a freely elected civilian government came to power in 1982. During the 1980s, Honduras proved a haven for anti-Sandinista contras fighting the Marxist Nicaraguan Government and an ally to Salvadoran Government forces fighting leftist guerrillas. The country was devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which killed about 5,600 people and caused approximately $2 billion in damage. Since then, the economy has slowly rebounded.","geo":{"Location":"Central America, bordering the Caribbean Sea, between Guatemala and Nicaragua and bordering the Gulf of Fonseca (North Pacific Ocean), between El Salvador and Nicaragua","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":15,"min":0},"W":{"deg":86,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":112090,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":111890,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":200,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Tennessee","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1520,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Guatemala 256 km, El Salvador 342 km, Nicaragua 922 km"},"Coastline":"Caribbean Sea 669 km;

While historically dependent on the export of bananas and coffee, Honduras has diversified its export base to include apparel and automobile wire harnessing. Nearly half of Honduras's economic activity is directly tied to the US, with exports to the US accounting for 30% of GDP and remittances for another 20%. The US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) came into force in 2006 and has helped foster foreign direct investment, but physical and political insecurity, as well as crime and perceptions of corruption, may deter potential investors; about 70% of FDI is from US firms. The economy registered sluggish economic growth in 2010, insufficient to improve living standards for the nearly 60% of the population in poverty. The LOBO administration inherited a difficult fiscal position with off-budget debts accrued in previous administrations and government salaries nearly equivalent to tax collections. His government has displayed a commitment to improving tax collection and cutting expenditures, and attracting foreign investment. This enabled Tegucigalpa to secure an IMF Precautionary Stand-By agreement in October 2010. The IMF agreement has helped renew multilateral and bilateral donor confidence in Honduras following the ZELAYA administration's economic mismanagement and the 2009 coup.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":33630000000.000004},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":15350000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":12.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":26.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":60.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3394000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":39.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":39.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":65,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":42.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":53.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":23.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":2923000000},"expenditures":{"usd":3651000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":26.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":19.16,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1296000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":7618000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":7581000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":6580000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":6540000000,"unit":"kWh"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":11800000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":56000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":46130,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.048 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":5879000000},"Imports":{"usd":8878000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":2302000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":3540000000},"Exchange rates":"lempiras (HNL) per US dollar -","industries":["sugar, coffee, woven and knit apparel, wood products, cigars"],"agricultureProducts":["bananas","coffee","citrus","corn","African palm","beef","timber","shrimp","tilapia","lobster"],"exportCommodities":["apparel","coffee","shrimp","wire harnesses","cigars","bananas","gold","palm oil","fruit","lobster","lumber"],"exportPartners":["US 59.6%","El Salvador 5.61%","Guatemala 5.28%","Mexico 4.19%","Germany 4.04%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","industrial raw materials","chemical products","fuels","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["US 46.81%","Guatemala 8.92%","El Salvador 7.13%","Mexico 5.54%","Costa Rica 4.91%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":830000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":7714000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"the number of fixed-line connections are increasing but still limited;
