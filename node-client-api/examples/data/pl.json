{"code":"pl","name":"Poland","region":"Europe","background":"Poland is an ancient nation that was conceived near the middle of the 10th century. Its golden age occurred in the 16th century. During the following century, the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation. In a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795, Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioned Poland among themselves. Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II. It became a Soviet satellite state following the war, but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union \"Solidarity\" that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency. A \"shock therapy\" program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe, but Poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment, underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure, and a poor rural underclass. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004. With its transformation to a democratic, market-oriented country largely completed, Poland is an increasingly active member of Euro-Atlantic organizations.","geo":{"Location":"Central Europe, east of Germany","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":52,"min":0},"E":{"deg":20,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":312685,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":304255,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":8430,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than New Mexico","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":3047,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Belarus 605 km, Czech Republic 615 km, Germany 456 km, Lithuania 91 km, Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast) 432 km, Slovakia 420 km, Ukraine 428 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":440,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":"defined by international treaties"},"Terrain":"mostly flat plain;

It is the only country in the European Union to maintain positive GDP growth through the 2008-2009 economic downturn. GDP per capita is still much below the EU average, but is similar to that of the three Baltic states. Since 2004, EU membership and access to EU structural funds have provided a major boost to the economy. Unemployment fell rapidly to 6.4% in October 2008, but climbed back to 11.8% for the year 2010, exceeding the EU average by more than 2%. Inflation reached a low of about 2.6% in 2010 due to the global economic slowdown but has since climbed and is expected to remain around 3%, and close to the upper limit of the National Bank of Poland's target rate. Poland's economic performance could improve over the longer term if the country addresses some of the remaining deficiencies in its road and rail infrastructure and its business environment. An inefficient commercial court system, a rigid labor code, bureaucratic red tape, burdensome tax system, and persistent low-level corruption keep the private sector from performing up to its full potential. Rising demands to fund health care, education, and the state pension system caused the public sector budget deficit to rise to 7.9% of GDP in 2010. The PO/PSL coalition government, which came to power in November 2007, has planned to reduce the budget deficit in 2011 and has also announced its intention to enact business-friendly reforms, increase workforce participation, reduce public sector spending growth, lower taxes, and accelerate privatization. The government has moved slowly on most major reforms, but has sped up privatization.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":721300000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":468500000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":32,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":64,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":17000000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":17.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":29.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":53.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":11.8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":27.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":34.9,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":91230000000},"expenditures":{"usd":128400000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":53.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.99,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":138700000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":251900000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":288700000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":135300000000.00002},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":149100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":129300000000.00002,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":9703000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":8480000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":34140,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":545400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":65280,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":553900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":96380000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":5842000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":16329999999.999998,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":40000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":9954000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":164800000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-12.33 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":160800000000},"Imports":{"usd":167400000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":99760000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":252900000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":198800000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":30710000000},"Exchange rates":"zlotych (PLN) per US dollar -","industries":["machine building, iron and steel, coal mining, chemicals, shipbuilding, food processing, glass, beverages, textiles"],"agricultureProducts":["potatoes","fruits","vegetables","wheat","poultry","eggs","pork","dairy"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment 37.8%","intermediate manufactured goods 23.7%","miscellaneous manufactured goods 17.1%","food and live animals 7.6%"],"exportPartners":["Germany 26.06%","Italy 6.84%","France 6.78%","UK 6.38%","Czech Republic 5.85%","Netherlands 4.14%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment 38%","intermediate manufactured goods 21%","chemicals 15%","minerals","fuels","lubricants","and related materials 9%"],"importPartners":["Germany 28.08%","Russia 8.65%","Italy 6.5%","Netherlands 5.59%","China 5.27%","France 4.6%","Czech Republic 4.05%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":9556000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":44553000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modernization of the telecommunications network has accelerated with market-based competition;
