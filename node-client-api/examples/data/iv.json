{"code":"iv","name":"Cote d'Ivoire","region":"Africa","background":"Close ties to France since independence in 1960, the development of cocoa production for export, and foreign investment made Cote d'Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the West African states, but did not protect it from political turmoil. In December 1999, a military coup - the first ever in Cote d'Ivoire's history - overthrew the government. Junta leader Robert GUEI blatantly rigged elections held in late 2000 and declared himself the winner. Popular protest forced him to step aside and brought Laurent GBAGBO into power. Ivorian dissidents and disaffected members of the military launched a failed coup attempt in September 2002. Rebel forces claimed the northern half of the country, and in January 2003 were granted ministerial positions in a unity government under the auspices of the Linas-Marcoussis Peace Accord. President GBAGBO and rebel forces resumed implementation of the peace accord in December 2003 after a three-month stalemate, but issues that sparked the civil war, such as land reform and grounds for citizenship, remained unresolved. In March 2007 President GBAGBO and former New Force rebel leader Guillaume SORO signed the Ouagadougou Political Agreement. As a result of the agreement, SORO joined GBAGBO's government as Prime Minister and the two agreed to reunite the country by dismantling the zone of confidence separating North from South, integrate rebel forces into the national armed forces, and hold elections. Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of rebel forces have been problematic as rebels seek to enter the armed forces. Citizen identification and voter registration pose election difficulties, and balloting planned for November 2009 was postponed to 2010. On 28 November 2010, Alassane Dramane OUATTARA won the presidential election, defeating then President Laurent GBAGBO. GBAGBO refused to hand over power, resulting in a 6-month stand-off. In April 2011, after widespread fighting, GBAGBO was formally forced from office by OUATTARA supporters with the support of UN and French forces. Several thousand UN troops and several hundred French remain in Cote d'Ivoire to support the transition process.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Ghana and Liberia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":8,"min":0},"W":{"deg":5,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":322463,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":318003,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":4460,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than New Mexico","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":3110,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Burkina Faso 584 km, Ghana 668 km, Guinea 610 km, Liberia 716 km, Mali 532 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":515,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"mostly flat to undulating plains;

Cote d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer and exporter of cocoa beans and a significant producer and exporter of coffee and palm oil. Consequently, the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for these products, and, to a lesser extent, in climatic conditions. Cocoa, oil, and coffee are the country's top export revenue earners, but the country is also producing gold. Since the end of the civil war in 2003, political turmoil has continued to damage the economy, resulting in the loss of foreign investment and slow economic growth. GDP grew by more than 2% in 2008 and around 4% per year in 2009-10. Per capita income has declined by 15% since 1999, but registered a slight improvement in 2009-10. Power cuts caused by a turbine failure in early 2010 slowed economic activity. Cote d'Ivoire in 2010 signed agreements to restructure its Paris Club bilateral, other bilateral, and London Club debt. Cote d'Ivoire's long term challenges include political instability and degrading infrastructure.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":37020000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":22820000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":28.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":21.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":50.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":7617000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":68,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":"NA (2007 est.)"},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":"NA%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":42,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":34,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":44.6,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":9.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":4755000000},"expenditures":{"usd":5158000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":63.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":5094000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":7653000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":5448000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":6141000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":5275000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":3231000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":772000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":58950,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":24000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":115700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":80960,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":250000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":1300000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":1300000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":28320000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":534000000},"Exports":{"usd":10250000000},"Imports":{"usd":7015000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3985000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":11600000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Communaute Financiere Africaine francs (XOF) per US dollar -","industries":["foodstuffs, beverages","wood products, oil refining, truck and bus assembly, textiles, fertilizer, building materials, electricity, ship construction and repair"],"agricultureProducts":["coffee","cocoa beans","bananas","palm kernels","corn","rice","manioc (tapioca)","sweet potatoes","sugar","cotton","rubber","timber"],"exportCommodities":["cocoa","coffee","timber","petroleum","cotton","bananas","pineapples","palm oil","fish"],"exportPartners":["Netherlands 13.92%","France 10.75%","US 7.79%","Germany 7.2%","Nigeria 6.99%","Ghana 5.56%"],"importCommodities":["fuel","capital equipment","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["Nigeria 20.75%","France 14.19%","China 7.18%","Thailand 5.09%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":282100,"Telephones - mobile cellular":13346000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"well developed by African standards;
