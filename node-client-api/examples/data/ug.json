{"code":"ug","name":"Uganda","region":"Africa","background":"The colonial boundaries created by Britain to delimit Uganda grouped together a wide range of ethnic groups with different political systems and cultures. These differences prevented the establishment of a working political community after independence was achieved in 1962. The dictatorial regime of Idi AMIN (1971-79) was responsible for the deaths of some 300,000 opponents; guerrilla war and human rights abuses under Milton OBOTE (1980-85) claimed at least another 100,000 lives. The rule of Yoweri MUSEVENI since 1986 has brought relative stability and economic growth to Uganda. During the 1990s, the government promulgated non-party presidential and legislative elections.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Africa, west of Kenya, east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":1,"min":0},"E":{"deg":32,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":241038,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":197100,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":43938,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

Uganda has never conducted a national minerals survey. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986, the government - with the support of foreign countries and international agencies - has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation and boosting production and export earnings. Since 1990 economic reforms ushered in an era of solid economic growth based on continued investment in infrastructure, improved incentives for production and exports, lower inflation, better domestic security, and the return of exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs. Uganda has received about $2 billion in multilateral and bilateral debt relief. In 2007 Uganda received $10 million for a Millennium Challenge Account Threshold Program. The global economic downturn has hurt Uganda's exports; however, Uganda's GDP growth is still relatively strong due to past reforms and sound management of the downturn. Oil revenues and taxes will become a larger source of government funding as oil comes on line in the next few years. Instability in southern Sudan is the biggest risk for the Ugandan economy in 2011 because Uganda's main export partner is Sudan, and Uganda is a key destination for Sudanese refugees.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":42150000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":17010000000.000002},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":23.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":51.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":15510000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":82,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":35,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":34.1,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":45.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":20.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":2457000000},"expenditures":{"usd":2938000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":20.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":9.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":9.65,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":20.96,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1997000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":3905000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1882000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":2256000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2068000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":30000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":13000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":13090,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1500000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-784 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":2941000000},"Imports":{"usd":4474000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3743000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Debt - external":{"usd":2888000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Ugandan shillings (UGX) per US dollar -","industries":["sugar, brewing, tobacco, cotton textiles","cement, steel production"],"agricultureProducts":["coffee","tea","cotton","tobacco","cassava (tapioca)","potatoes","corn","millet","pulses","cut flowers","beef","goat meat","milk","poultry"],"exportCommodities":["coffee","fish and fish products","tea","cotton","flowers","horticultural products","gold"],"exportPartners":["Sudan 13.47%","Kenya 8.98%","UAE 7.52%","Rwanda 7.5%","Switzerland 7.42%","Democratic Republic of the Congo 6.85%","Netherlands 5.67%","Belgium 5.66%","Germany 5.18%","Italy 4.33%"],"importCommodities":["capital equipment","vehicles","petroleum","medical supplies","cereals"],"importPartners":["Kenya 13.9%","India 12.79%","UAE 11.16%","China 8.91%","South Africa 5.08%","France 4.6%","Japan 4.37%","US 4.07%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":233500,"Telephones - mobile cellular":9384000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"mobile cellular service is increasing rapidly, but the number of main lines is still deficient;
