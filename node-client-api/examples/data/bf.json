Tourism together with tourism-driven construction and manufacturing accounts for approximately 60% of GDP and directly or indirectly employs half of the archipelago's labor force. Prior to 2006, a steady growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels, resorts, and residences led to solid GDP growth but since then tourism receipts have begun to drop off. The global recession in 2009 took a sizeable toll on the Bahamas, resulting in a contraction in GDP and a widening budget deficit. The decline continued in 2010 as tourism from the US and sector investment lagged. Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy and, when combined with business services, account for about 36% of GDP. However, the financial sector currently is smaller than it has been in the past because of the enactment of new and stricter financial regulations in 2000 that caused many international businesses to relocate elsewhere. Manufacturing and agriculture combined contribute approximately a tenth of GDP and show little growth, despite government incentives aimed at those sectors. Overall growth prospects in the short run rest heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":8921000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":7538000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":14.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":84.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":184000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"tourism":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"},"other services":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.6,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":9.3,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":{"quantity":27,"unit":"%"}},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1030000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1030000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":5.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1284000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":5991000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":7993000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":2045000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":1902000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":36000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":"transshipments of 41,570 bbl/day (2007 est.)","Oil - imports":{"quantity":20560,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-283.2 million (2009 est.)","Exports":{"usd":674000000},"Imports":{"usd":2401000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":342600000},"Exchange rates":"Bahamian dollars (BSD) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, banking, cement, oil transshipment, salt, rum, aragonite, pharmaceuticals, spiral-welded steel pipe"],"agricultureProducts":["citrus","vegetables","poultry"],"exportCommodities":["mineral products and salt","animal products","rum","chemicals","fruit and vegetables"],"exportPartners":["US 35.99%","Singapore 18.64%","Poland 12.1%","Germany 6.24%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","manufactures","chemicals","mineral fuels","food and live animals"],"importPartners":["US 27.23%","South Korea 20.08%","Japan 14.55%","Singapore 5.89%","China 4.75%","Venezuela 4.26%","Italy 4.12%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":129000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":358800,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern facilities","domestic":"totally automatic system;
