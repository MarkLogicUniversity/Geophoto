{"code":"zi","name":"Zimbabwe","region":"Africa","background":"The UK annexed Southern Rhodesia from the [British] South Africa Company in 1923. A 1961 constitution was formulated that favored whites in power. In 1965 the government unilaterally declared its independence, but the UK did not recognize the act and demanded more complete voting rights for the black African majority in the country (then called Rhodesia). UN sanctions and a guerrilla uprising finally led to free elections in 1979 and independence (as Zimbabwe) in 1980. Robert MUGABE, the nation's first prime minister, has been the country's only ruler (as president since 1987) and has dominated the country's political system since independence. His chaotic land redistribution campaign, which began in 2000, caused an exodus of white farmers, crippled the economy, and ushered in widespread shortages of basic commodities. Ignoring international condemnation, MUGABE rigged the 2002 presidential election to ensure his reelection. The ruling ZANU-PF party used fraud and intimidation to win a two-thirds majority in the March 2005 parliamentary election, allowing it to amend the constitution at will and recreate the Senate, which had been abolished in the late 1980s. In April 2005, Harare embarked on Operation Restore Order, ostensibly an urban rationalization program, which resulted in the destruction of the homes or businesses of 700,000 mostly poor supporters of the opposition. President MUGABE in June 2007 instituted price controls on all basic commodities causing panic buying and leaving store shelves empty for months. General elections held in March 2008 contained irregularities but still amounted to a censure of the ZANU-PF-led government with the opposition winning a majority of seats in parliament. MDC opposition leader Morgan TSVANGIRAI won the most votes in the presidential polls, but not enough to win outright. In the lead up to a run-off election in late June 2008, considerable violence enacted against opposition party members led to the withdrawal of TSVANGIRAI from the ballot. Extensive evidence of violence and intimidation resulted in international condemnation of the process. Difficult negotiations over a power-sharing government, in which MUGABE remained president and TSVANGIRAI became prime minister, were finally settled in February 2009, although the leaders have yet failed to agree upon many key outstanding governmental issues. Mugabe in October publicly called for early elections in 2011-two years before his term ends-but no election date has been set.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Africa, between South Africa and Zambia","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":20,"min":0},"E":{"deg":30,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":390757,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":386847,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":3910,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Montana","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":3066,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Botswana 813 km, Mozambique 1,231 km, South Africa 225 km, Zambia 797 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"mostly high plateau with higher central plateau (high veld);

Following a decade of contraction, Zimbabwe's economy recorded real growth of 5.9% in 2010. But the government of Zimbabwe still faces a number of difficult economic problems, including a large external debt burden and insufficient formal employment. Zimbabwe's 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy. The government's land reform program, characterized by chaos and violence, has badly damaged the commercial farming sector, the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs, turning Zimbabwe into a net importer of food products. The EU and the US provide food aid on humanitarian grounds, though on a smaller scale than before. Until early 2009, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit, causing hyperinflation. The power-sharing government formed in February 2009 has led to some economic improvements, including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the Zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls. The economy is registering its first growth in a decade, but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":5457000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":7474000000}},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":19.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":56.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3848000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":66,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":95,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":68,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":40.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":50.1,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":2250000000},"expenditures":{"usd":2250000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":149,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.03,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA% (31 December 2010)","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)"},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":3057000},"Stock of domestic credit":"$NA","Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":4470000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":8890000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":10890000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":32000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":2691000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":11000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":13830,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.503 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":2540000000},"Imports":{"usd":4043000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":376000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":7662000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Zimbabwean dollars (ZWD) per US dollar -","industries":["mining (coal, gold, platinum, copper, nickel, tin, diamonds, clay, numerous metallic and nonmetallic ores), steel","wood products, cement, chemicals, fertilizer, clothing and footwear, foodstuffs, beverages"],"agricultureProducts":["corn","cotton","tobacco","wheat","coffee","sugarcane","peanuts","sheep","goats","pigs"],"exportCommodities":["platinum","cotton","tobacco","gold","ferroalloys","textiles/clothing"],"exportPartners":["Democratic Republic of the Congo 14.82%","South Africa 13.39%","Botswana 13.23%","China 7.82%","Zambia 7.3%","Netherlands 5.39%","UK 4.93%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","other manufactures","chemicals","fuels","food products"],"importPartners":["South Africa 62.24%","China 4.2%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":385100,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2991000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"system was once one of the best in Africa, but now suffers from poor maintenance","domestic":"consists of microwave radio relay links, open-wire lines, radiotelephone communication stations, fixed wireless local loop installations, and a substantial mobile-cellular network;
