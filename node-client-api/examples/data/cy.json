{"code":"cy","name":"Cyprus","region":"Europe","background":"A former British colony, Cyprus became independent in 1960 following years of resistance to British rule. Tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head in December 1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia. Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic intercommunal violence continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek Government-sponsored attempt to seize control of Cyprus was met by military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than a third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot-occupied area declared itself the \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\" (\"TRNC\"), but it is recognized only by Turkey. The election of a new Cypriot president in 2008 served as the impetus for the UN to encourage both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to reopen unification negotiations. In September 2008, the leaders of the two communities began negotiations under UN auspices aimed at reuniting the divided island; the talks remain ongoing. The entire island entered the EU on 1 May 2004, although the EU acquis - the body of common rights and obligations - applies only to the areas under the internationally recognized government, and is suspended in the areas administered by Turkish Cypriots. However, individual Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other citizens of European Union states.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, island in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Turkey","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":35,"min":0},"E":{"deg":33,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":9251,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":9241,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":10,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"about 0.6 times the size of Connecticut","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":150.4,"unit":"km"},"border sovereign base areas":"Akrotiri 47.4 km, Dhekelia 103 km (approximately)"},"Coastline":{"quantity":648,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"central plain with mountains to north and south;

Tourism, financial services, and real estate are the most important sectors. Erratic growth rates over the past decade reflect the economy's reliance on tourism, the profitability of which often fluctuates with political instability in the region and economic conditions in Western Europe. Nevertheless, the economy in the area under government control has grown at a rate well above the EU average since 2000. Cyprus joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM2) in May 2005 and adopted the euro as its national currency on 1 January 2008. An aggressive austerity program in the preceding years, aimed at paving the way for the euro, helped turn a soaring fiscal deficit (6.3% in 2003) into a surplus of 1.2% in 2008, and reduced inflation to 4.7%. This prosperity came under pressure in 2009, as construction and tourism slowed in the face of reduced foreign demand triggered by the ongoing global financial crisis. Although Cyprus lagged behind its EU peers in showing signs of stress from the global crisis, the economy tipped into recession in 2009, contracting by 1.8%, and has been slow to bounce back since, posting an anemic growth rate of 0.6% in 2010. In addition, the budget deficit is on the rise and reached 5.7% of GDP in 2010, a violation of the EU's budget deficit criteria of no more than 3% of GDP. In response to the country's deteriorating finances, Nicosia is promising to implement measures to cut the cost of the state payroll, curb tax evasion, and revamp social benefits. However, it has been slow to act, lacking a consensus in parliament and among the social partners for its proposed measures.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":23190000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":23170000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":18.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":79.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":400000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":8.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":71,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.6,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":29,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues:":{"usd":9308000000},"expenditures:":{"usd":10610000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":61.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":7.49,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":4341000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":50500000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":101200000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":4993000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":4502000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":4277000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":59000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":58930,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.5 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":2232000000},"Imports":{"usd":7962000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":29360000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":16570000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","Economy of the area administered by Turkish Cypriots":{"Economy - overview":"The Turkish Cypriot economy has roughly half the per capita GDP of the south, and economic growth tends to be volatile, given the north's relative isolation, bloated public sector, reliance on the Turkish lira, and small market size.
