{"code":"rq","name":"Puerto Rico","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Populated for centuries by aboriginal peoples, the island was claimed by the Spanish Crown in 1493 following COLUMBUS' second voyage to the Americas. In 1898, after 400 years of colonial rule that saw the indigenous population nearly exterminated and African slave labor introduced, Puerto Rico was ceded to the US as a result of the Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans were granted US citizenship in 1917. Popularly-elected governors have served since 1948. In 1952, a constitution was enacted providing for internal self government. In plebiscites held in 1967, 1993, and 1998, voters chose not to alter the existing political status.","geo":{"Location":"Caribbean, island between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, east of the Dominican Republic","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":18,"min":15},"W":{"deg":66,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":13790,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":8870,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":4921,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than three times the size of Rhode Island","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":501,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"mostly mountains with coastal plain belt in north;

Sugar production has lost out to dairy production and other livestock products as the main source of income in the agricultural sector.
