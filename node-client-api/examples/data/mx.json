{"code":"mx","name":"Mexico","region":"North America","background":"The site of advanced Amerindian civilizations, Mexico came under Spanish rule for three centuries before achieving independence early in the 19th century. A devaluation of the peso in late 1994 threw Mexico into economic turmoil, triggering the worst recession in over half a century. The global financial crisis beginning in late 2008 caused another massive economic downturn the following year. As the economy recovers, ongoing economic and social concerns include low real wages, underemployment for a large segment of the population, inequitable income distribution, and few advancement opportunities for the largely Amerindian population in the impoverished southern states. The elections held in 2000 marked the first time since the 1910 Mexican Revolution that an opposition candidate - Vicente FOX of the National Action Party (PAN) - defeated the party in government, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He was succeeded in 2006 by another PAN candidate Felipe CALDERON. National elections, including the presidential election, are scheduled for July 2012. Since 2007, Mexico's powerful drug-trafficking organizations have engaged in bloody fueding, resulting in tens of thousands of drug-related homicides.","geo":{"Location":"Middle America, bordering the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, between Belize and the United States and bordering the North Pacific Ocean, between Guatemala and the United States","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":23,"min":0},"W":{"deg":102,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":1964,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":1943,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":20430,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than three times the size of Texas","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":4353,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Belize 250 km, Guatemala 962 km, US 3,141 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":9330,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"high, rugged mountains;

It contains a mixture of modern and outmoded industry and agriculture, increasingly dominated by the private sector. Recent administrations have expanded competition in seaports, railroads, telecommunications, electricity generation, natural gas distribution, and airports. Per capita income is roughly one-third that of the US; income distribution remains highly unequal. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, Mexico's share of US imports has increased from 7% to 12%, and its share of Canadian imports has doubled to 5%. Mexico has free trade agreements with over 50 countries including, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, the European Free Trade Area, and Japan, putting more than 90% of trade under free trade agreements. In 2007, during its first year in office, the Felipe CALDERON administration was able to garner support from the opposition to successfully pass pension and fiscal reforms. The administration passed an energy reform measure in 2008 and another fiscal reform in 2009. Mexico's GDP plunged 6.5% in 2009 as world demand for exports dropped, asset prices tumbled, and remittances and investment declined. GDP posted positive growth of 5% in 2010, with exports - particularly to the United States - leading the way, while domestic consumption and investment lagged. The administration continues to face many economic challenges, including improving the public education system, upgrading infrastructure, modernizing labor laws, and fostering private investment in the energy sector. CALDERON has stated that his top economic priorities remain reducing poverty and creating jobs.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1567000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1038999999999.9999},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":33.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":62.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":46990000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":13.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":23.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":62.9,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.6,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":18.2,"unit":"%"}},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":36.3,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":48.2,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":237000000000},"expenditures":{"usd":267000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":41.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":7.07,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":135699999999.99998},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":583800000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":342400000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":340600000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":245000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":181500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":1288000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":584000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":3001000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2077999.9999999998,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1225000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":521100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":12420000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":60350000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":59800000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":688000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":11840000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":359700000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-7 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":303000000000},"Imports":{"usd":306000000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":116400000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":212500000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":328400000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":62930000000},"Exchange rates":"Mexican pesos (MXN) per US dollar -","industries":["food and beverages, tobacco, chemicals, iron and steel, petroleum, mining, textiles, clothing, motor vehicles, consumer durables, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["corn","wheat","soybeans","rice","beans","cotton","coffee","fruit","tomatoes","beef","poultry","dairy products","wood products"],"exportCommodities":["manufactured goods","oil and oil products","silver","fruits","vegetables","coffee","cotton"],"exportPartners":["US 80.5%","Canada 3.6%","Germany 1.4% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["metalworking machines","steel mill products","agricultural machinery","electrical equipment","car parts for assembly","repair parts for motor vehicles","aircraft","and aircraft parts"],"importPartners":["US 48%","China 13.5%","Japan 4.8%","South Korea 4.6%","Germany 4.1% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":19425000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":83528000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"adequate telephone service for business and government;
