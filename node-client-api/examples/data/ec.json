{"code":"ec","name":"Ecuador","region":"South America","background":"What is now Ecuador formed part of the northern Inca Empire until the Spanish conquest in 1533. Quito became a seat of Spanish colonial government in 1563 and part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717. The territories of the Viceroyalty - New Granada (Colombia), Venezuela, and Quito - gained their independence between 1819 and 1822 and formed a federation known as Gran Colombia. When Quito withdrew in 1830, the traditional name was changed in favor of the \"Republic of the Equator.\" Between 1904 and 1942, Ecuador lost territories in a series of conflicts with its neighbors. A border war with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999. Although Ecuador marked 30 years of civilian governance in 2004, the period was marred by political instability. Protests in Quito contributed to the mid-term ouster of three of Ecuador's last four democratically elected Presidents. In September 2008, voters approved a new constitution, Ecuador's 20th since gaining independence. General elections, under the new constitutional framework, were held in April 2009, and voters re-elected President Rafael CORREA.","geo":{"Location":"Western South America, bordering the Pacific Ocean at the Equator, between Colombia and Peru","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":2,"min":0},"W":{"deg":77,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":283561,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":276841,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":6720,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Nevada","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":2010,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Colombia 590 km, Peru 1,420 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2237,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"100 nm from 2,500-m isobath"},"Terrain":"coastal plain (costa), inter-Andean central highlands (sierra), and flat to rolling eastern jungle (oriente)","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Chimborazo 6,267 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":5.71,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":4.81,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":89.48,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":8650,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":432,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":16.98,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":1283,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"frequent earthquakes;

In 1999/2000, Ecuador suffered a severe economic crisis, with GDP contracting by 5.3%. Poverty increased significantly, the banking system collapsed, and Ecuador defaulted on its external debt. In March 2000, the Congress approved a series of structural reforms that also provided for the adoption of the US dollar as legal tender. Dollarization stabilized the economy, and positive growth returned in the years that followed, helped by high oil prices, remittances, and increased non-traditional exports. From 2002-06 the economy grew an average of 5.2% per year, the highest five-year average in 25 years. After moderate growth in 2007, the economy reached a growth rate of 7.2% in 2008, in large part due to high global petroleum prices and increased public sector investment. President Rafael CORREA, who took office in January 2007, defaulted in December 2008 on Ecuador's sovereign debt, which, with a total face value of approximately US$3.2 billion, represented about 80% of Ecuador's private external debt. In May 2009, Ecuador bought back 91% of its \"defaulted\" bonds via an international auction. Economic policies under the CORREA administration - including an announcement in late 2009 of its intention to terminate 13 bilateral investment treaties, including one with the United States - have generated economic uncertainty and discouraged private investment. The Ecuadorian economy contracted 0.4% in 2009 due to the global financial crisis and to the sharp decline in world oil prices and remittance flows. Growth picked up to a 3.7% rate in 2010, according to Ecuadorian government estimates.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":115000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":58910000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":6.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":35.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":57.7,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":"4.59 million (urban) (2010 est.)","Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":8.3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":21.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":70.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":33.1,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":35.3,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":{"Distribution of family income - Gini index":46.9,"country comparison to the world":""},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":23.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":14480000000},"expenditures":{"usd":18210000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":23.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":8.68,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":6198000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":21220000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":17470000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":4248000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":16420000000.000002,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":15810000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":20680000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":1120000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":485700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":181000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":338000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":80500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":6542000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":283200000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":283200000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":7985000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-692 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":17370000000},"Imports":{"usd":17650000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3590000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":14710000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":12300000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Exchange rates":"the US dollar became El Salvador's currency in 2001","industries":["petroleum, food processing, textiles, wood products, chemicals"],"agricultureProducts":["bananas","coffee","cocoa","rice","potatoes","manioc (tapioca)","plantains","sugarcane","cattle","sheep","pigs","beef","pork","dairy products","balsa wood","fish","shrimp"],"exportCommodities":["petroleum","bananas","cut flowers","shrimp","cacao","coffee","wood","fish"],"exportPartners":["US 33.5%","Peru 6.8%","Chile 6.5%","Columbia 4.9% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["industrial materials","fuels and lubricants","nondurable consumer goods"],"importPartners":["US 25.4%","Columbia 10.6%","Venezuela 6.5%","Brazil 4.5% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":2004000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":13635000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"generally elementary but being expanded","domestic":"fixed-line services provided by multiple telecommunications operators;
