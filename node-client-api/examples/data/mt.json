Malta's geographic position between the EU and Africa makes it a target for illegal immigration, which has strained Malta's political and economic resources. Malta adopted the euro on 1 January 2008. Malta's financial services industry has grown in recent years and in 2008-09 it escaped significant damage from the international financial crisis, largely because the sector is centered on the indigenous real estate market and is not highly leveraged. Locally, the restricted damage from the financial crisis has been attributed to the stability of the Maltese banking system and to its prudent risk-management practices. The global economic downturn and high electricity and water prices hurt Malta's real economy, which is dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing - especially electronics and pharmaceuticals - and tourism, but growth bounced back as the global economy recovered in 2010. Following a 1.2% contraction in 2009, GDP grew 2% in 2010. In early 2011, the EU ended excessive deficit procedures against Malta, after Malta had taken measures to correct an excessive deficit in 2010 and appeared likely to reach its deficit target of 2.8% of GDP in 2011.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":10410000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":8288000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":17.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":80.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":163100,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":73.9,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":8.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":4455000000},"expenditures":{"usd":3322000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":69.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":4.47,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":7046000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":13210000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":18660000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1982000000},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":2113000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":1991000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":19000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":17910,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-362.8 million (2010)","Exports":{"usd":3124000000},"Imports":{"usd":5159000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":522000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":5978000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":16629999999.999998},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1213000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, electronics, ship building and repair, construction, food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, footwear, clothing, tobacco, aviation services, financial services, information technology services"],"agricultureProducts":["potatoes","cauliflower","grapes","wheat","barley","tomatoes","citrus","cut flowers","green peppers","pork","milk","poultry","eggs"],"exportCommodities":["electrical machinery","mechanical appliances","fish and crustaceans","pharmaceutical products","printed material"],"exportPartners":["Germany 13.3%","Singapore 12.5%","France 11.4%","US 9.4%","Hong Kong 6.5%","UK 5.9%","Italy 4.8% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["mineral fuels and oils","electrical machinery","non-electrical machinery","aircraft and other transport equipment","plastic and other semi-manufactured goods","food","drink","tobacco"],"importPartners":["Italy 24.4%","UK 11.7%","Germany 9.3%","France 7.6%","China 4.2% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":252700,"Telephones - mobile cellular":422100,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"automatic system featuring submarine cable and microwave radio relay between islands","domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular subscribership exceeds 165 per 100 persons","international":"country code - 356;
