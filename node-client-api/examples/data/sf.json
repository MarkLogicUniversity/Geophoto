{"code":"sf","name":"South Africa","region":"Africa","background":"Dutch traders landed at the southern tip of modern day South Africa in 1652 and established a stopover point on the spice route between the Netherlands and the Far East, founding the city of Cape Town. After the British seized the Cape of Good Hope area in 1806, many of the Dutch settlers (the Boers) trekked north to found their own republics. The discovery of diamonds (1867) and gold (1886) spurred wealth and immigration and intensified the subjugation of the native inhabitants. The Boers resisted British encroachments but were defeated in the Boer War (1899-1902); however, the British and the Afrikaners, as the Boers became known, ruled together beginning in 1910 under the Union of South Africa, which became a republic in 1961 after a whites-only referendum. In 1948, the National Party was voted into power and instituted a policy of apartheid - the separate development of the races - which favored the white minority at the expense of the black majority. The African National Congress (ANC) led the opposition to apartheid and many top ANC leaders, such as Nelson MANDELA, spent decades in South Africa's prisons. Internal protests and insurgency, as well as boycotts by some Western nations and institutions, led to the regime's eventual willingness to negotiate a peaceful transition to majority rule. The first multi-racial elections in 1994 brought an end to apartheid and ushered in majority rule under an ANC-led government. South Africa since then has struggled to address apartheid-era imbalances in decent housing, education, and health care. ANC infighting, which has grown in recent years, came to a head in September 2008 when President Thabo MBEKI resigned, and Kgalema MOTLANTHE, the party's General-Secretary, succeeded him as interim president. Jacob ZUMA became president after the ANC won general elections in April 2009. In January 2011, South Africa assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011-12 term.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Africa, at the southern tip of the continent of Africa","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":29,"min":0},"E":{"deg":24,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":1219,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":1214,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":4620,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than twice the size of Texas","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":4862,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Botswana 1,840 km, Lesotho 909 km, Mozambique 491 km, Namibia 967 km, Swaziland 430 km, Zimbabwe 225 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2798,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or to edge of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"vast interior plateau rimmed by rugged hills and narrow coastal plain","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Njesuthi 3,408 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":12.1,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.79,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":87.11,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":14980,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":50,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":12.5,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":264,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"prolonged droughts","volcanism":"the volcano forming Marion Island in the Prince Edward Islands, which last erupted in 2004, is South Africa's only active volcano"},"internationalEnvironmentAgreements":{"signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements","partyTo":["Antarctic-Environmental Protocol","Antarctic-Marine Living Resources","Antarctic Seals","Antarctic Treaty","Biodiversity","Climate Change","Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol","Desertification","Endangered Species","Hazardous Wastes","Law of the Sea","Marine Dumping","Marine Life Conservation","Ozone Layer Protection","Ship Pollution","Wetlands","Whaling"]},"naturalResources":["gold","chromium","antimony","coal","iron ore","manganese","nickel","phosphates","tin","rare earth elements","uranium","gem diamonds","platinum","copper","vanadium","salt","natural gas"],"environmentalIssues":["lack of important arterial rivers or lakes requires extensive water conservation and control measures","growth in water usage outpacing supply","pollution of rivers from agricultural runoff and urban discharge","air pollution resulting in acid rain","soil erosion","desertification"],"climate":["mostly semiarid","subtropical along east coast","sunny days, cool nights"],"geographyNote":["South Africa completely surrounds Lesotho and almost completely surrounds Swaziland"]},"people":{"Population":{"Population":49004,"country comparison to the world":""},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":28.5,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":65.8,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"5.7% (male 1,125,709/female 1,660,694) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":25,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":24.7,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":25.3,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":"-0.38% (2011 est.)","Birth rate":{"quantity":19.48,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":17.09,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":{"Net migration rate":"-6.19 migrant(s)/1,000 population","country comparison to the world":""},"Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":62,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Major cities - population":"Johannesburg 3.607 million;

At the end of 2007, South Africa began to experience an electricity crisis. State power supplier Eskom encountered problems with aged plants, necessitating \"load-shedding\" cuts to residents and businesses in the major cities. Growth was robust from 2004 to 2007 as South Africa reaped the benefits of macroeconomic stability and a global commodities boom, but began to slow in the second half of 2007 due to the electricity crisis and the subsequent global financial crisis' impact on commodity prices and demand. GDP fell nearly 2% in 2009. Unemployment remains high and outdated infrastructure has constrained growth. Daunting economic problems remain from the apartheid era - especially poverty, lack of economic empowerment among the disadvantaged groups, and a shortage of public transportation. South Africa's former economic policy was fiscally conservative, focusing on controlling inflation, and attaining a budget surplus. The current government largely follows the same prudent policies, but must contend with the impact of the global crisis and is facing growing pressure from special interest groups to use state-owned enterprises to deliver basic services to low-income areas and to increase job growth. More than a quarter of South Africa's population currently receives social grants.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":524000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":357300000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":31.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":65.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":"17.32 million economically active (2010 est.)","Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":65,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":23.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":44.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":65,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":103100000000},"expenditures":{"usd":126200000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":33.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.71,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":65870000000.00001},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":256200000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":328300000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":704800000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":240300000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":215100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":14160000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":10570000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":191000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":579000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":128500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":490500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":15000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":3250000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":6450000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":3200000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":27160000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-16.51 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":76860000000},"Imports":{"usd":77040000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":45520000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":80520000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":83080000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":53380000000},"Exchange rates":"rand (ZAR) per US dollar -","industries":["mining (world's largest producer of platinum, gold, chromium), automobile assembly, metalworking, machinery, textiles, iron and steel, chemicals, fertilizer, foodstuffs, commercial ship repair"],"agricultureProducts":["corn","wheat","sugarcane","fruits","vegetables","beef","poultry","mutton","wool","dairy products"],"exportCommodities":["gold","diamonds","platinum","other metals and minerals","machinery and equipment"],"exportPartners":["China 10.34%","US 9.19%","Japan 7.59%","Germany 7.01%","UK 5.54%","Switzerland 4.72%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","chemicals","petroleum products","scientific instruments","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["China 17.21%","Germany 11.24%","US 7.38%","Saudi Arabia 4.87%","Japan 4.67%","Iran 3.95%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":4320000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":46436000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"the system is the best developed and most modern in Africa","domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity roughly 105 telephones per 100 persons;
