{"code":"wq","name":"Wake Island","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"The US annexed Wake Island in 1899 for a cable station. An important air and naval base was constructed in 1940-41. In December 1941, the island was captured by the Japanese and held until the end of World War II. In subsequent years, Wake was developed as a stopover and refueling site for military and commercial aircraft transiting the Pacific. Since 1974, the island's airstrip has been used by the US military, as well as for emergency landings. Operations on the island were suspended and all personnel evacuated in 2006 with the approach of super typhoon IOKE (category 5), but resultant damage was comparatively minor. A US Air Force repair team restored full capability to the airfield and facilities, which remains a vital strategic link in the Pacific region.","geo":{"Location":"Oceania, atoll in the North Pacific Ocean, about two-thirds of the way from Hawaii to the Northern Mariana Islands","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":19,"min":17},"E":{"deg":166,"min":39}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"about 11 times the size of The Mall in Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":19.3,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"atoll of three low coral islands, Peale, Wake, and Wilkes, built up on an underwater volcano; central lagoon is former crater, islands are part of the rim","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"unnamed location 6 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"},"Natural hazards":"occasional typhoons","naturalResources":["none"],"environmentalIssues":["NA"],"climate":["tropical"],"geographyNote":["strategic location in the North Pacific Ocean","emergency landing location for transpacific flights"]},"people":{"Population":{"Population":"no indigenous inhabitants"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":"NA","Education expenditures":"NA"},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"none","conventional short form":"Wake Island"},"Dependency status":"unorganized, unincorporated territory of the US; administered from Washington, DC by the Department of the Interior; activities in the atoll are currently conducted by the US Air Force","Legal system":"US common law","Flag description":"the flag of the US is used"},"economy":{"Economy - overview":"Economic activity is limited to providing services to military personnel and contractors located on the island.
