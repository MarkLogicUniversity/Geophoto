The per capita level of output and standard of living are comparable to those of the most prosperous regions of Italy, which supplies much of its food. San Marino boasts the world's longest life expectancy for men with 80 years. The economy benefits from foreign investment due to its relatively low corporate taxes and low taxes on interest earnings. San Marino has recently faced increased international pressure to improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities and transparency within its own banking sector, which generates about one-fifth of the country's tax revenues. Italy's implementation in October 2009 of a tax amnesty to repatriate untaxed funds held abroad has resulted in financial outflows from San Marino to Italy worth more than $4.5 billion. Such outflows, combined with a money-laundering scandal at San Marino's largest financial institution and the recent global economic downturn, have contributed to a deep recession and growing budget deficit. Industrial production declined sharply in 2010, especially in the textile sector. However, San Marino has little national debt, and an unemployment rate less than half the size of Italy's. The San Marino government has adopted measures to counter the downturn, including subsidized credit to businesses. San Marino also continues to work towards harmonizing its fiscal laws with EU members and international standards. In September 2009, the OECD removed San Marino from its list of tax havens that have yet to fully implement global tax standards, and in 2010 San Marino signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements with most major countries. The future of the country's economy will be heavily influenced by the signing of a financial information exchange agreement with Italy, which many Italian investors see as fundamental for their business operations with San Marino.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1137000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1535000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-13% (2009 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":39.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":60.7,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":22950,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":36.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":63.5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":882100000},"expenditures":{"usd":940400000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.39,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":"$NA (31 December 2008)","Stock of broad money":"$NA (31 December 2008)","Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":8822000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":"-4.9% (2009)","Exports":{"usd":2436000000},"Imports":{"usd":2165000000},"Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, banking, textiles, electronics, ceramics, cement, wine"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","grapes","corn","olives","cattle","pigs","horses","beef","cheese","hides"],"exportCommodities":["building stone","lime","wood","chestnuts","wheat","wine","baked goods","hides","ceramics"],"importCommodities":["wide variety of consumer manufactures","food"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":21500,"Telephones - mobile cellular":24000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"automatic telephone system completely integrated into Italian system","domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity 150 telephones per 100 persons","international":"country code - 378; connected to Italian international network"},"Broadcast media":"state-owned public broadcaster operates 1 TV station and 2 radio stations; receives radio and TV broadcasts from Italy (2008)","Internet country code":".sm","Internet hosts":8895,"Internet users":17000},"transport":{"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":292,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":292,"unit":"km"}}},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces; voluntary Military Force (Corpi Militari) performs ceremonial duties and limited police support functions (2010)","Military service age and obligation":"16-55 for voluntary service in Voluntary Military Force (2006)","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":6892},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":5565,"females age 16-49":6067},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":186,"female":166},"Military expenditures":"NA","Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of Italy"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
