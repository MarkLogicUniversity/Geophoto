{"code":"gr","name":"Greece","region":"Europe","background":"Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1829. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, it gradually added neighboring islands and territories, most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II, Greece was first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied by Germany (1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war between supporters of the king and other anti-Communists and Communist rebels. Following the latter's defeat in 1949, Greece joined NATO in 1952. In 1967, a group of military officers seized power, establishing a military dictatorship that suspended many political liberties and forced the king to flee the country. In 1974, democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and abolished the monarchy. In 1981, Greece joined the EC (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the European Economic and Monetary Union in 2001. In 2010, the prospect of a Greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the EMU and raised the question of whether a member country might voluntarily leave the common currency or be removed.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Europe, bordering the Aegean Sea, Ionian Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea, between Albania and Turkey","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":39,"min":0},"E":{"deg":22,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":131957,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":130647,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":1310,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Alabama","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1228,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Albania 282 km, Bulgaria 494 km, Turkey 206 km, Macedonia 246 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":13676,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"mostly mountains with ranges extending into the sea as peninsulas or chains of islands","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Mediterranean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Mount Olympus 2,917 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":20.45,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":8.59,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":70.96,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":15500,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":72,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":8.7,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":782,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"severe earthquakes","volcanism":"Santorini (elev. 367 m) has been deemed a \"Decade Volcano\" by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy of study due to its explosive history and close proximity to human populations;

Tourism provides 15% of GDP. Immigrants make up nearly one-fifth of the work force, mainly in agricultural and unskilled jobs. Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid, equal to about 3.3% of annual GDP. The Greek economy grew by nearly 4.0% per year between 2003 and 2007, due partly to infrastructural spending related to the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, and in part to an increased availability of credit, which has sustained record levels of consumer spending. But the economy went into recession in 2009 as a result of the world financial crisis, tightening credit conditions, and Athens' failure to address a growing budget deficit, which was triggered by falling state revenues, and increased government expenditures. The economy contracted by 2% in 2009, and 4.8% in 2010. Greece violated the EU's Growth and Stability Pact budget deficit criterion of no more than 3% of GDP from 2001 to 2006, but finally met that criterion in 2007-08, before exceeding it again in 2009, with the deficit reaching 15.4% of GDP. Austerity measures reduced the deficit to 9.4% of GDP in 2010. Public debt, inflation, and unemployment are above the euro-zone average while per capita income is below; unemployment rose to 12% in 2010. Eroding public finances, a credibility gap stemming from inaccurate and misreported statistics, and consistent underperformance on following through with reforms prompted major credit rating agencies in late 2009 to downgrade Greece's international debt rating, and has led the country into a financial crisis. Under intense pressure by the EU and international market participants, the government has adopted a medium-term austerity program that includes cutting government spending, reducing the size of the public sector, decreasing tax evasion, reforming the health care and pension systems, and improving competitiveness through structural reforms to the labor and product markets. Athens, however, faces long-term challenges to push through unpopular reforms in the face of often vocal opposition from the country's powerful labor unions and the general public. Greek labor unions are striking over new austerity measures, but the strikes so far have had a limited impact on the government's will to adopt reforms. An uptick in widespread unrest, however, could challenge the government's ability to implement reforms and meet budget targets, and could also lead to rioting or violence. In April 2010 a leading credit agency assigned Greek debt its lowest possible credit rating; in May, the International Monetary Fund and Eurozone governments provided Greece emergency short- and medium-term loans worth $147 billion so that the country could make debt repayments to creditors. In exchange for the largest bailout ever assembled, the government announced combined spending cuts and tax increases totaling $40 billion over three years, on top of the tough austerity measures already taken. Greece, however, struggled to boost revenues and cut spending to meet 2010 targets set by the EU and the IMF, especially after Eurostat - the EU's statistical office - revised upward Greece's deficit and debt numbers for 2009 and 2010. Greece's lenders are calling on Athens to step up efforts in 2011 to increase tax collection, shore up public enterprises, and rein in health spending, and are planning to give Greece more time to repay its EU-IMF loan. Greece responded by introducing major structural reforms, but investors still question whether Greece can sustain fiscal efforts in the face of a bleak economic outlook and public discontent.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":318100000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":305400000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-4.5% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":17.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":78.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5050000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":12.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":22.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":65.1,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":33,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":14.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":114500000000},"expenditures":{"usd":142900000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":144,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8.59,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":152800000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":335900000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":419900000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":54720000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":58790000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":58280000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":1962000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":7575000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":6779,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":414400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":153000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":520900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":10000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":9000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":3528000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":3556000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":991100000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-17.1 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":21140000000},"Imports":{"usd":44900000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":532900000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":48100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":38660000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, food and tobacco processing, textiles, chemicals, metal products","mining, petroleum"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","corn","barley","sugar beets","olives","tomatoes","wine","tobacco","potatoes","beef","dairy products"],"exportCommodities":["food and beverages","manufactured goods","petroleum products","chemicals","textiles"],"exportPartners":["Germany 11.11%","Italy 11.05%","Cyprus 7.28%","Bulgaria 6.74%","US 4.95%","UK 4.4%","Turkey 4.23%"],"importCommodities":["machinery","transport equipment","fuels","chemicals"],"importPartners":["Germany 13.73%","Italy 12.71%","China 7.08%","France 6.1%","Netherlands 6.02%","South Korea 5.68%","Belgium 4.34%","Spain 4.08%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":5930000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":13295000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"adequate, modern networks reach all areas;
