{"code":"ks","name":"Korea, South","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"An independent Korean state or collection of states has existed almost continuously for several millennia. Between its initial unification in the 7th century - from three predecessor Korean states - until the 20th century, Korea existed as a single independent country. In 1905, following the Russo-Japanese War, Korea became a protectorate of imperial Japan, and in 1910 it was annexed as a colony. Korea regained its independence following Japan's surrender to the United States in 1945. After World War II, a Republic of Korea (ROK) was set up in the southern half of the Korean Peninsula while a Communist-style government was installed in the north (the DPRK). During the Korean War (1950-53), US troops and UN forces fought alongside soldiers from the ROK to defend South Korea from DPRK attacks supported by China and the Soviet Union. An armistice was signed in 1953, splitting the peninsula along a demilitarized zone at about the 38th parallel. Thereafter, South Korea achieved rapid economic growth with per capita income rising to roughly 17 times the level of North Korea. In 1993, KIM Young-sam became South Korea's first civilian president following 32 years of military rule. South Korea today is a fully functioning modern democracy. President LEE Myung-bak has pursued a policy of global engagement since taking office in February 2008, highlighted by Seoul's hosting of the G-20 summit in November 2010. Serious tensions with North Korea have punctuated inter-Korean relations in recent years, including the North's sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan in March 2010 and its artillery attack on South Korean soldiers and citizens in November 2010.","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Asia, southern half of the Korean Peninsula bordering the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":37,"min":0},"E":{"deg":127,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":99720,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":96920,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":2800,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Indiana","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":238,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"North Korea 238 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2413,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":"12 nm;

Four decades ago, GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries of Africa and Asia. In 2004, South Korea joined the trillion dollar club of world economies, and currently is among the world's 20 largest economies. Initially, a system of close government and business ties, including directed credit and import restrictions, made this success possible. The government promoted the import of raw materials and technology at the expense of consumer goods, and encouraged savings and investment over consumption. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 exposed longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development model including high debt/equity ratios and massive short-term foreign borrowing. GDP plunged by 6.9% in 1998, and then recovered by 9% in 1999-2000. Korea adopted numerous economic reforms following the crisis, including greater openness to foreign investment and imports. Growth moderated to about 4-5% annually between 2003 and 2007. With the global economic downturn in late 2008, South Korean GDP growth slowed to 0.2% in 2009. In the third quarter of 2009, the economy began to recover, in large part due to export growth, low interest rates, and an expansionary fiscal policy, and growth exceeded 6% in 2010. The South Korean economy's long term challenges include a rapidly aging population, inflexible labor market, and overdependence on manufacturing exports to drive economic growth.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1459000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1006999999999.9999},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":39.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":57.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":24620000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":7.3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":68.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":24.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":31.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":28.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":248300000000},"expenditures":{"usd":267300000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":23.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.65,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":101900000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1346000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1057000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":836500000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":12.1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":417000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":402000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":48180,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2185000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"Oil - exports":{"quantity":907100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":3074000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":651000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":34090000000.000004,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":32689999999.999996,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":50000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":36350000000},"Exports":{"usd":466300000000},"Imports":{"usd":417900000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":274600000000.00003},"Debt - external":{"usd":370100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":112100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":115600000000},"Exchange rates":"South Korean won (KRW) per US dollar -","industries":["electronics, telecommunications, automobile production, chemicals, shipbuilding, steel"],"agricultureProducts":["rice","root crops","barley","vegetables","fruit","cattle","pigs","chickens","milk","eggs","fish"],"exportCommodities":["semiconductors","wireless telecommunications equipment","motor vehicles","computers","steel","ships","petrochemicals"],"exportPartners":["China 23.2%","US 10.1%","Japan 5.8%","Hong Kong 5.3% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["machinery","electronics and electronic equipment","oil","steel","transport equipment","organic chemicals","plastics"],"importPartners":["China 16.8%","Japan 15.3%","US 9%","Saudi Arabia 6.1%","Australia 4.6% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":19289000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":47944000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"excellent domestic and international services featuring rapid incorporation of new technologies","domestic":"fixed-line and mobile-cellular services widely available with a combined telephone subscribership of roughly 140 per 100 persons;
