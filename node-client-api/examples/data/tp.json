While independence was achieved in 1975, democratic reforms were not instituted until the late 1980s. The country held its first free elections in 1991, but frequent internal wrangling between the various political parties precipitated repeated changes in leadership and two failed coup attempts in 1995 and 2003. The recent discovery of oil in the Gulf of Guinea promises to attract increased attention to the small island nation.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, islands in the Gulf of Guinea, straddling the Equator, west of Gabon","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":1,"min":0},"E":{"deg":7,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":964,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":964,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

overview":"This small, poor island economy has become increasingly dependent on cocoa since independence in 1975. Cocoa production has substantially declined in recent years because of drought and mismanagement. Sao Tome and Principe has to import all fuels, most manufactured goods, consumer goods, and a substantial amount of food. Over the years, it has had difficulty servicing its external debt and has relied heavily on concessional aid and debt rescheduling. Sao Tome and Principe benefited from $200 million in debt relief in December 2000 under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program, which helped bring down the country's $300 million debt burden. In August 2005, the government signed on to a new 3-year IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program worth $4.3 million. Considerable potential exists for development of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The government also has attempted to reduce price controls and subsidies. Potential exists for the development of petroleum resources in Sao Tome and Principe's territorial waters in the oil-rich Gulf of Guinea, which are being jointly developed in a 60-40 split with Nigeria, but any actual production is at least several years off. The first production licenses were sold in 2004, though a dispute over licensing with Nigeria delayed the country's receipt of more than $20 million in signing bonuses for almost a year.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":311000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":196000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":14.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":22.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":62.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":52490,"Labor force - by occupation":{"note":"population mainly engaged in subsistence agriculture and fishing; shortages of skilled workers"},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":54,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":41,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":35560000},"expenditures":{"usd":38640000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":32.4,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":17180000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":82200000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":17140000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":19000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":17670000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":725.5,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-73 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":13000000},"Imports":{"usd":99000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":46000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":318000000},"Exchange rates":"dobras (STD) per US dollar -","industries":["light construction, textiles, soap, beer, fish processing, timber"],"agricultureProducts":["cocoa","coconuts","palm kernels","copra","cinnamon","pepper","coffee","bananas","papayas","beans","poultry","fish"],"exportCommodities":["cocoa 80%","copra","coffee","palm oil"],"exportPartners":["UK 32.99%","Netherlands 26.93%","Belgium 21.04%","Portugal 4.31%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and electrical equipment","food products","petroleum products"],"importPartners":["Portugal 58.9%","Brazil 6.68%","US 4.71%","Japan 4.49%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":7800,"Telephones - mobile cellular":64000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"local telephone network of adequate quality with most lines connected to digital switches","domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity roughly 35 telephones per 100 persons","international":"country code - 239; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2008)"},"Broadcast media":"1 government-owned TV station; 1 government-owned radio station; 3 independent local radio stations authorized in 2005 with 2 operating at the end of 2006; transmissions of multiple international broadcasters are available (2007)","Internet country code":".st","Internet hosts":1514,"Internet users":26700},"transport":{"Airports":2,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":2,"1,524 to 2,437 m":1,"914 to 1,523 m":1},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":320,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":218,"unit":"km"},"unpaved":{"quantity":102,"unit":"km"}},"Merchant marine":{"total":3,"country comparison to the world":"","by type":"bulk carrier 1, cargo 2","foreign-owned":"1 (Greece 1) (2010)"},"Ports and terminals":"Sao Tome"},"military":{"Military branches":"Armed Forces of Sao Tome and Principe (Forcas Armadas de Sao Tome e Principe, FASTP): Army, Coast Guard of Sao Tome e Principe (Guarda Costeira de Sao Tome e Principe, GCSTP), Presidential Guard (2010)","Military service age and obligation":"18 years of age (est.)
