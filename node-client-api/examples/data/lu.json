It lost more than half of its territory to Belgium in 1839 but gained a larger measure of autonomy. Full independence was attained in 1867. Overrun by Germany in both world wars, it ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the following year. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the European Economic Community (later the European Union), and in 1999 it joined the euro currency area.","geo":{"Location":"Western Europe, between France and Germany","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":49,"min":45},"E":{"deg":6,"min":10}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":2586,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":2586,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Rhode Island","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":359,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Belgium 148 km, France 73 km, Germany 138 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"mostly gently rolling uplands with broad, shallow valleys;

The industrial sector, initially dominated by steel, has become increasingly diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other products. Growth in the financial sector, which now accounts for about 28% of GDP, has more than compensated for the decline in steel. Most banks are foreign owned and have extensive foreign dealings, but Luxembourg has lost some of its advantages as a tax haven because of OECD and EU pressure. The economy depends on foreign and cross-border workers for about 60% of its labor force. Luxembourg, like all EU members, suffered from the global economic crisis that began in late 2008, but unemployment has trended below the EU average. Following strong expansion from 2004 to 2007, Luxembourg's economy contracted and 3.7% in 2009, but rebounded 3.2% in 2010. The country continues to enjoy an extraordinarily high standard of living - GDP per capita ranks third in the world, after Liechtenstein and Qatar, and is the highest in the EU. Turmoil in the world financial markets and lower global demand during 2008-09 prompted the government to inject capital into the banking sector and implement stimulus measures to boost the economy. Government stimulus measures and support for the banking sector, however, led to a 5% government budget deficit in 2009. Nevertheless, the deficit was cut below 3% in 2010.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":41090000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":54950000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":13.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":86,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":206000,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":17.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":80.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":23.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":16.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":20880000000},"expenditures":{"usd":22110000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":16.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":120800000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":255500000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":395100000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":105600000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":2696000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":6525000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":2483000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":6830000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":50720,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":63,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":59210,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":1268000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1263000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":3396000000},"Exports":{"usd":17820000000},"Imports":{"usd":23670000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":1892000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA (31 December 2009 est.)","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["banking and financial services, iron and steel, information technology, telecommunications, cargo transportation, food processing, chemicals, metal products, engineering, tires, glass, aluminum, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["grapes","barley","oats","potatoes","wheat","fruits","dairy and livestock products"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and equipment","steel products","chemicals","rubber products","glass"],"exportPartners":["Germany 19.78%","France 15.87%","Belgium 11.07%","UK 7.96%","Italy 7.49%","Netherlands 4.31%"],"importCommodities":["minerals","metals","foodstuffs","quality consumer goods"],"importPartners":["Belgium 27.22%","Germany 23.14%","China 18.62%","France 8.85%","Netherlands 5.06%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":273600,"Telephones - mobile cellular":719000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"highly developed, completely automated and efficient system, mainly buried cables","domestic":"fixed line teledensity over 50 per 100 persons;
