The services sector accounts for 40% of GDP. Gold and cocoa production and individual remittances are major sources of foreign exchange. Oil production at Ghana's offshore Jubilee field began in mid-December and is expected to boost economic growth. Ghana signed a Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact in 2006, which aims to assist in transforming Ghana's agricultural sector. Ghana opted for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) program in 2002, and is also benefiting from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative that took effect in 2006. In 2009 Ghana signed a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the IMF to improve macroeconomic stability, private sector competitiveness, human resource development, and good governance and civic responsibility. Sound macro-economic management along with high prices for gold and cocoa helped sustain GDP growth in 2008-10. In early 2010 President John Atta MILLS targeted recovery from high inflation and current account and budget deficits as his priorities.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":61970000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":31080000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":33.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":41.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":10560000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":56,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":29,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":28.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":32.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":39.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":39.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":5518000000},"expenditures":{"usd":7025000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":59.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":10.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":6260000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":9583000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":7155000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":2508000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":6746000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":5702000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":249000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":435000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":7081,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":57000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":4843,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":45380,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":15000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":22650000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.871 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":7326000000},"Imports":{"usd":10180000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3800000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":6483000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"cedis (GHC) per US dollar -","industries":["mining, lumbering, light manufacturing, aluminum smelting, food processing, cement, small commercial ship building"],"agricultureProducts":["cocoa","rice","cassava (tapioca)","peanuts","corn","shea nuts","bananas","timber"],"exportCommodities":["gold","cocoa","timber","tuna","bauxite","aluminum","manganese ore","diamonds","horticulture"],"exportPartners":["Netherlands 13.45%","UK 7.87%","France 5.85%","Ukraine 5.84%","Malaysia 3.97%"],"importCommodities":["capital equipment","petroleum","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["China 16.8%","Nigeria 11.88%","US 6.63%","Cote d'Ivoire 5.99%","India 5.57%","France 5.09%","UK 4.23%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":267400,"Telephones - mobile cellular":15109000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"primarily microwave radio relay;
