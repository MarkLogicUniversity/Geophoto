It has a narrow export base in agricultural goods. Squash, vanilla beans, and yams are the main crops. Agricultural exports, including fish, make up two-thirds of total exports. The country must import a high proportion of its food, mainly from New Zealand. The country remains dependent on external aid and remittances from Tongan communities overseas to offset its trade deficit. Tourism is the second-largest source of hard currency earnings following remittances. Tonga had 39,000 visitors in 2006. The government is emphasizing the development of the private sector, especially the encouragement of investment, and is committing increased funds for health and education. Tonga has a reasonably sound basic infrastructure and well developed social services. High unemployment among the young, a continuing upturn in inflation, pressures for democratic reform, and rising civil service expenditures are major issues facing the government.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":751000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":363000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":57,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":39960,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":31.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":30.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":2003,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":80480000},"expenditures":{"usd":109800000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.9,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":12.47,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":44640000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":153800000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":149200000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":43000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":39990000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1173,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-23 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":22000000},"Imports":{"usd":139000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":40830000},"Debt - external":{"usd":80700000},"Exchange rates":"pa'anga (TOP) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, construction, fishing"],"agricultureProducts":["squash","coconuts","copra","bananas","vanilla beans","cocoa","coffee","ginger","black pepper","fish"],"exportCommodities":["squash","fish","vanilla beans","root crops"],"exportPartners":["Hong Kong 25.42%","US 22.65%","Japan 12.21%","NZ 7.31%","Fiji 7.2%","Samoa 6.06%","South Korea 4.48%"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","machinery and transport equipment","fuels","chemicals"],"importPartners":["Fiji 34.37%","NZ 25.03%","US 9.43%","Australia 7.53%","China 5.64%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":31000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":53000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"competition between Tonga Telecommunications Corporation (TCC) and Shoreline Communications Tonga (SCT) is accelerating expansion of telecommunications;
