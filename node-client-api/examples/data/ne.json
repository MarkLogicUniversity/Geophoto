Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, and the shortfall is made up by critically needed grants from New Zealand that are used to pay wages to public employees. Niue has cut government expenditures by reducing the public service by almost half. The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of population because of emigration to New Zealand. Efforts to increase GDP include the promotion of tourism and financial services, although the International Banking Repeal Act of 2002 resulted in the termination of all offshore banking licenses. Economic aid from New Zealand in FY08/09 was US$5.7 million. Niue suffered a devastating typhoon in January 2004, which decimated nascent economic programs. While in the process of rebuilding, Niue has been dependent on foreign aid.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":10010000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":10010000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":23.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":26.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":49.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":663,"Labor force - by occupation":{"note":"most work on family plantations; paid work exists only in government service, small industry, and the Niue Development Board"},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":15070000},"expenditures":{"usd":16329999.999999998}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":3000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2790000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":30.66,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":null},"Imports":{"usd":9038000},"Debt - external":{"usd":null},"Exchange rates":"New Zealand dollars (NZD) per US dollar -","industries":["handicrafts, food processing"],"agricultureProducts":["coconuts","passion fruit","honey","limes","taro","yams","cassava (tapioca)","sweet potatoes","pigs","poultry","beef cattle"],"exportCommodities":["canned coconut cream","copra","honey","vanilla","passion fruit products","pawpaws","root crops","limes","footballs","stamps","handicrafts"],"importCommodities":["food","live animals","manufactured goods","machinery","fuels","lubricants","chemicals","drugs"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1100,"Telephones - mobile cellular":600,"Telephone system":{"domestic":"single-line telephone system connects all villages on island","international":"country code - 683 (2001)"},"Broadcast media":"1 government-owned television station with many of the programs supplied by Television New Zealand; 1 government-owned radio station broadcasting in AM and FM (2009)","Internet country code":".nu","Internet hosts":397270,"Internet users":1100},"transport":{"Airports":1,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":1,"1,524 to 2,437 m":1},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":120,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":120,"unit":"km"}},"Ports and terminals":"Alofi"},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular indigenous military forces; Police Force","Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of New Zealand"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
