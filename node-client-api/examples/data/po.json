A 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy; for most of the next six decades, repressive governments ran the country. In 1974, a left-wing military coup installed broad democratic reforms. The following year, Portugal granted independence to all of its African colonies. Portugal is a founding member of NATO and entered the EC (now the EU) in 1986. In January 2011, Portugal assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011-12 term.","geo":{"Location":"Southwestern Europe, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, west of Spain","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":39,"min":30},"W":{"deg":8,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":92090,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":91470,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":620,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Indiana","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1214,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Spain 1,214 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1793,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"mountainous north of the Tagus River, rolling plains in south","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Ponta do Pico (Pico or Pico Alto) on Ilha do Pico in the Azores 2,351 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":17.29,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":7.84,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":74.87,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":5840,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":73.6,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":11.09,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":1056,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"Azores subject to severe earthquakes","volcanism":"Portugal experiences limited volcanic activity in the Azores Islands;

Over the past two decades, successive governments have privatized many state-controlled firms and liberalized key areas of the economy, including the financial and telecommunications sectors. The country qualified for the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 1998 and began circulating the euro on 1 January 2002 along with 11 other EU members. The economy had grown by more than the EU average for much of the 1990s, but fell back in 2001-08, and contracted 2.6% in 2009, before growing 1% in 2010. GDP per capita stands at roughly two-thirds of the EU-27 average. A poor educational system and a rigid labor market have been obstacles to greater productivity and growth. Portugal also has been increasingly overshadowed by lower-cost producers in Central Europe and Asia as a destination for foreign direct investment. Portugal's low competitiveness, low growth prospects, and high levels of public debt have made it vulnerable to bond market turbulence. The government is implementing austerity measures, including a 5% public salary cut which went into effect on January 1, 2011 and a 2% increase in the value-added tax, to reduce the budget deficit from 9.3% of GDP in 2009 to 4.6% in 2011, but some investors have expressed concern about the government's ability to achieve these targets and cover its sovereign debt. Without the option for stimulus measures, the government is focusing instead on boosting exports and implementing labor market reforms to try to raise GDP growth and increase Portugal's competitiveness - which, over time, may help mitigate investor concerns.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":247000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":229300000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":74.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5570000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":11.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":28.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":59.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":10.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":28.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":38.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":93610000000},"expenditures":{"usd":110200000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":83.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":6.12,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":98230000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":282000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":556300000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":98650000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":44470000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":48780000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":1313000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":10740000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":4721,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":272200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":53660,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":323000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":"NA","Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":4846000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":4895000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-19.03 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":46270000000},"Imports":{"usd":68220000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":497800000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":105700000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":63640000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["textiles, clothing, footwear, wood and cork, paper, chemicals, auto-parts manufacturing, base metals, dairy products, wine and other foods, porcelain and ceramics, glassware, technology, telecommunications","ship construction and refurbishment","tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["grain","potatoes","tomatoes","olives","grapes","sheep","cattle","goats","pigs","poultry","dairy products","fish"],"exportCommodities":["agricultural products","food products","wine","oil products","chemical products","plastics and rubber","hides","leather","wood and cork","wood pulp and paper","textile materials","clothing","footwear","machinery and tools"],"exportPartners":["Spain 26.25%","Germany 12.99%","France 12.04%","Angola 7.21%","UK 5.54%"],"importCommodities":["agricultural products","chemical products","vehicles and other transport material","and optical and precision instruments","computer accessories and parts","semi-conductors and related devices"],"importPartners":["Spain 31.58%","Germany 12.41%","France 8.58%","Italy 5.55%","Netherlands 5.31%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":4049000.0000000005,"Telephones - mobile cellular":15178000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"Portugal's telephone system has a state-of-the-art network with broadband, high-speed capabilities","domestic":"integrated network of coaxial cables, open-wire, microwave radio relay, and domestic satellite earth stations","international":"country code - 351;
