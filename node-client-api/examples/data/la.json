{"code":"la","name":"Laos","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"Modern-day Laos has its roots in the ancient Lao kingdom of Lan Xang, established in the 14th Century under King FA NGUM. For 300 years Lan Xang had influence reaching into present-day Cambodia and Thailand, as well as over all of what is now Laos. After centuries of gradual decline, Laos came under the domination of Siam (Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the Communist Pathet Lao took control of the government ending a six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime closely aligned to Vietnam. A gradual, limited return to private enterprise and the liberalization of foreign investment laws began in 1988. Laos became a member of ASEAN in 1997.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Asia, northeast of Thailand, west of Vietnam","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":18,"min":0},"E":{"deg":105,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":236800,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":230800,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":6000,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Utah","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":5083,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Burma 235 km, Cambodia 541 km, China 423 km, Thailand 1,754 km, Vietnam 2,130 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"mostly rugged mountains;

The results, starting from an extremely low base, were striking - growth averaged 6% per year from 1988-2008 except during the short-lived drop caused by the Asian financial crisis that began in 1997. Despite this high growth rate, Laos remains a country with an underdeveloped infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. It has a rudimentary, but improving, road system, and limited external and internal telecommunications. China has signed a deal with the Lao to build a high speed rail system in the country. Construction on the $7 billion project is slated to begin in April 2011 and will take five years. Electricity is available in urban areas and in many rural districts. Subsistence agriculture, dominated by rice cultivation in lowland areas, accounts for about 30% of GDP and 75% of total employment. The government in FY09/10 received $586 million from international donors. Economic growth has reduced official poverty rates from 46% in 1992 to 26% in 2010. The economy has benefited from high foreign investment in hydropower, mining, and construction. Laos gained Normal Trade Relations status with the US in 2004, and is taking steps required to join the World Trade Organization, such as reforming import licensing. Related trade policy reforms will improve the business environment. On the fiscal side, Laos initiated a VAT tax system in 2010. Simplified investment procedures and expanded bank credits for small farmers and small entrepreneurs will improve Lao's economic prospects. The government appears committed to raising the country's profile among investors. The World Bank has declared that Laos's goal of graduating from the UN Development Program's list of least-developed countries by 2020 is achievable. According Laotian officials, the 7th Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2011-15 will outline efforts to achieve Millennium Development Goals.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":15690000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":6341000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":29.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":31.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":38.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3690000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":75.1,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":"NA (2010 est.)"},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":28.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":34.6,"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1137000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1328000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":630000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1818000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1562000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":17.7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1553000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2230000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":341000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":999000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1918,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1918,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":"NA cu m (2008 est.)","Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":"NA cu m (2008 est.)","Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-195 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1950000000},"Imports":{"usd":1504000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":756000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":5797000000},"Exchange rates":"kips (LAK) per US dollar -","industries":["copper, tin, gold, and gypsum mining","timber, electric power, agricultural processing, construction, garments, cement, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["sweet potatoes","vegetables","corn","coffee","sugarcane","tobacco","cotton","tea","peanuts","rice","water buffalo","pigs","cattle","poultry"],"exportCommodities":["wood products","coffee","electricity","tin","copper","gold"],"exportPartners":["Thailand 29.18%","China 15.04%","Vietnam 14.96%","UK 4.29%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","vehicles","fuel","consumer goods"],"importPartners":["Thailand 66.2%","China 11.45%","Vietnam 5.3%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":132200,"Telephones - mobile cellular":3235000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"service to general public is poor but improving;
