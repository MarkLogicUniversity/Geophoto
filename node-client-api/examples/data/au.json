{"code":"au","name":"Austria","region":"Europe","background":"Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in World War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's status remained unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation, recognized Austria's independence, and forbade unification with Germany. A constitutional law that same year declared the country's \"perpetual neutrality\" as a condition for Soviet military withdrawal. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and Austria's entry into the European Union in 1995 have altered the meaning of this neutrality. A prosperous, democratic country, Austria entered the EU Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.","geo":{"Location":"Central Europe, north of Italy and Slovenia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":47,"min":20},"E":{"deg":13,"min":20}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":83871,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":82445,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":1426,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Maine","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":2562,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Czech Republic 362 km, Germany 784 km, Hungary 366 km, Italy 430 km, Liechtenstein 35 km, Slovakia 91 km, Slovenia 330 km, Switzerland 164 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"in the west and south mostly mountains (Alps);

Its economy features a large service sector, a sound industrial sector, and a small, but highly developed agricultural sector. Following several years of solid foreign demand for Austrian exports and record employment growth, the international financial crisis and global economic downturn in 2008 led to a sharp but brief recession. Austrian GDP contracted 3.9% in 2009 but saw positive growth of about 2% in 2010. Unemployment has not risen as steeply in Austria as elsewhere in Europe, partly because its government has subsidized reduced working hour schemes to allow companies to retain employees. Stabilization measures, stimulus spending, and an income tax reform pushed the budget deficit to 3.5% of GDP in 2009 and 4.7% in 2010, from only about 1.3% in 2008. The international financial crisis caused difficulties for Austria's largest banks whose extensive operations in central, eastern, and southeastern Europe faced large losses. The government provided bank support - including in some instances, nationalization - to prevent insolvency and possible contagion. In the medium-term all large Austrian banks will need additional capital. Even after the global economic outlook improves, Austria will need to continue restructuring, emphasize knowledge-based sectors of the economy, and encourage greater labor flexibility and labor participation to offset growing unemployment and Austria's aging population and low fertility rate.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":332000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":376800000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":29.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":69.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3700000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":27.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":67,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":172100000000},"expenditures":{"usd":189400000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":70.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":4.82,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":173400000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":402800000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":659200000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":118000000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":68850000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":65670000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":18760000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":19540000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":21880,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":247700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":50410,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":273000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":89000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":1580000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":8130000000.000001,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":3961000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":9460000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":24800000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":9900000000},"Exports":{"usd":157400000000},"Imports":{"usd":156000000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":21890000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":755000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":154000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":154100000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["construction, machinery, vehicles and parts, food, metals, chemicals, lumber and wood processing, paper and paperboard, communications equipment, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["grains","potatoes","wine","fruit","dairy products","cattle","pigs","poultry","lumber"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and equipment","motor vehicles and parts","paper and paperboard","metal goods","chemicals","iron and steel","textiles","foodstuffs"],"exportPartners":["Germany 30.96%","Italy 8.17%","Switzerland 4.99%","US 3.99%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","motor vehicles","chemicals","metal goods","oil and oil products","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["Germany 45.07%","Switzerland 6.76%","Italy 6.66%","Netherlands 4.03%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":3253000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":11773000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"highly developed and efficient","domestic":"fixed-line subscribership has been in decline since the mid-1990s with mobile-cellular subscribership eclipsing it by the late 1990s;
