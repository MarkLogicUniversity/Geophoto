{"code":"jm","name":"Jamaica","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"The island - discovered by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1494 - was settled by the Spanish early in the 16th century. The native Taino Indians, who had inhabited Jamaica for centuries, were gradually exterminated and replaced by African slaves. England seized the island in 1655 and established a plantation economy based on sugar, cocoa, and coffee. The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed a quarter million slaves, many of whom became small farmers. Jamaica gradually obtained increasing independence from Britain. In 1958 it joined other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation of the West Indies. Jamaica gained full independence when it withdrew from the Federation in 1962. Deteriorating economic conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival gangs affiliated with the major political parties evolved into powerful organized crime networks involved in international drug smuggling and money laundering. Violent crime, drug trafficking, and poverty pose significant challenges to the government today. Nonetheless, many rural and resort areas remain relatively safe and contribute substantially to the economy.","geo":{"Location":"Caribbean, island in the Caribbean Sea, south of Cuba","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":18,"min":15},"W":{"deg":77,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":10991,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":10831,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":160,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

The country continues to derive most of its foreign exchange from tourism, remittances, and bauxite/alumina. Remittances account for nearly 15% of GDP and exports of bauxite and alumina make up about 10%. The bauxite/alumina sector was most affected by the global downturn while the tourism industry was resilient, experiencing an increase of 4% in tourist arrivals. Tourism revenues account for roughly 10% of GDP, and both arrivals and revenues grew in 2010, up 4% and 6% respectively. The Economic growth faces many challenges: high crime and corruption, large-scale unemployment and underemployment, and a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120%. Jamaica's onerous public debt burden - the fourth highest in the world on a per capita basis - is the result of government bailouts to ailing sectors of the economy, most notably to the financial sector in the mid-to-late 1990s. In early 2010, the Jamaican government created the Jamaica Debt Exchange (JDX) in order to retire high-priced domestic bonds and significantly reduce annual debt servicing. The Government of Jamaica signed a $1.27 billion, 27-month Standby Agreement with the International Monetary Fund for balance of payment support in February 2010. Other multilaterals have also provided millions of dollars in loans and grants. Despite the improvement, debt servicing costs still hinder the government's ability to spend on infrastructure and social programs, particularly as job losses rise in a shrinking economy. The GOLDING administration faces the difficult prospect of having to achieve fiscal discipline in order to maintain debt payments, while simultaneously attacking a serious crime problem that is hampering economic growth. High unemployment exacerbates the crime problem, including gang violence that is fueled by the drug trade.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":23720000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":13690000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-1.1% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":29.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":64.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1317000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":64,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":12.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":16.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":35.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":45.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":25.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":3611000000},"expenditures":{"usd":4644000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":123.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":16.43,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1432000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":5782000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":7922000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":6201000000},"Industrial production growth rate":"-2% (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":7324000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":6345000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":77000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":77720,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.382 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1487000000},"Imports":{"usd":5378000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1850000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":12660000000},"Exchange rates":"Jamaican dollars (JMD) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, bauxite/alumina, agro processing, light manufactures, rum, cement, metal, paper, chemical products, telecommunications"],"agricultureProducts":["sugarcane","bananas","coffee","citrus","yams","ackees","vegetables","poultry","goats","milk","crustaceans","mollusks"],"exportCommodities":["alumina","bauxite","sugar","rum","coffee","yams","beverages","chemicals","wearing apparel","mineral fuels"],"exportPartners":["US 38.19%","Canada 12.2%","UK 10.79%","Norway 4.89%","Netherlands 4.69%"],"importCommodities":["food and other consumer goods","industrial supplies","fuel","parts and accessories of capital goods","machinery and transport equipment","construction materials"],"importPartners":["US 28.32%","Trinidad and Tobago 22.98%","Venezuela 12.14%","China 4.61%","Brazil 4.18%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":302300,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2971000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"fully automatic domestic telephone network","domestic":"the 1999 agreement to open the market for telecommunications services resulted in rapid growth in mobile-cellular telephone usage while the number of fixed-lines in use has declined;
