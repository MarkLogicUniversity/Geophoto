{"code":"nc","name":"New Caledonia","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"Settled by both Britain and France during the first half of the 19th century, the island was made a French possession in 1853. It served as a penal colony for four decades after 1864. Agitation for independence during the 1980s and early 1990s ended in the 1998 Noumea Accord, which over a period of 15 to 20 years will transfer an increasing amount of governing responsibility from France to New Caledonia. The agreement also commits France to conduct a referendum between 2014 and 2019 to decide whether New Caledonia should assume full sovereignty and independence.","geo":{"Location":"Oceania, islands in the South Pacific Ocean, east of Australia","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":21,"min":30},"E":{"deg":165,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":18575,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":18275,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":300,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than New Jersey","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2254,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"coastal plains with interior mountains","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Mont Panie 1,628 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0.32,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.22,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":99.46,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":100,"unit":"sq km"},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"cyclones, most frequent from November to March","volcanism":"Matthew and Hunter Islands are historically active"},"naturalResources":["nickel","chrome","iron","cobalt","manganese","silver","gold","lead","copper"],"environmentalIssues":["erosion caused by mining exploitation and forest fires"],"climate":["tropical","modified by southeast trade winds","hot, humid"],"geographyNote":["consists of the main island of New Caledonia (one of the largest in the Pacific Ocean), the archipelago of Iles Loyaute, and numerous small, sparsely populated islands and atolls"]},"people":{"Population":256275,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":24.9,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":67.3,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"7.8% (male 8,954/female 10,989) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":30.1,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":29.6,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":30.7,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":1.524,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":16.28,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":5.28,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":{"Net migration rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"migrant(s)/1,000 population"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":57,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Major cities - population":"NOUMEA (capital) 144,000 (2009)","Sex ratio":{"at birth":{"quantity":1.05,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years":{"quantity":1.04,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":1.01,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over":{"quantity":0.86,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population":{"quantity":1,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":{"quantity":5.71,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":6.75,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"female":{"quantity":4.62,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"}},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":{"quantity":76.75,"unit":"years"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":72.67,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":81.03,"unit":"years"}},"Total fertility rate":{"quantity":2.07,"unit":"children born/woman"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":"NA","HIV/AIDS - deaths":"NA","Nationality":{"noun":"New Caledonian(s)","adjective":"New Caledonian"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":{"quantity":96.2,"unit":"%"},"male":{"quantity":96.8,"unit":"%"},"female":{"quantity":95.5,"unit":"%"}},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":"NA","Education expenditures":"NA","ethnicGroups":["Melanesian 44.1%","European 34.1%","Wallisian & Futunian 9%","Tahitian 2.6%","Indonesian 2.5%","Vietnamese 1.4%","Ni-Vanuatu 1.1%","other 5.2% (1996 census)"],"religions":["Roman Catholic 60%","Protestant 30%","other 10%"],"languages":["French (official)","33 Melanesian-Polynesian dialects"]},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"Territory of New Caledonia and Dependencies","conventional short form":"New Caledonia","local long form":"Territoire des Nouvelle-Caledonie et Dependances","local short form":"Nouvelle-Caledonie"},"Dependency status":"territorial collectivity (or a sui generis collectivity) of France since 1998","Government type":"NA","Capital":{"name":"Noumea","geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":22,"min":16},"E":{"deg":166,"min":27}},"time difference":"UTC+11 (16 hours ahead of Washington, DC during Standard Time)"},"Independence":"none (overseas territory of France);
