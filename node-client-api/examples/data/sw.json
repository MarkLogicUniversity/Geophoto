It has a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external communications, and a skilled labor force. In September 2003, Swedish voters turned down entry into the euro system concerned about the impact on the economy and sovereignty. Timber, hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. Agriculture accounts for little more than 1% of GDP and of employment. Until 2008, Sweden was in the midst of a sustained economic upswing, boosted by increased domestic demand and strong exports. This and robust finances offered the center-right government considerable scope to implement its reform program aimed at increasing employment, reducing welfare dependence, and streamlining the state's role in the economy. Despite strong finances and underlying fundamentals, the Swedish economy slid into recession in the third quarter of 2008 and growth continued downward in 2009 as deteriorating global conditions reduced export demand and consumption. Strong exports of commodities and a return to profitability by Sweden's banking sector drove the strong rebound in 2010.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":354700000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":455800000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":26.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":72.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4930000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":28.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":70.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":22.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":23,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":230100000000},"expenditures":{"usd":236600000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":40.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":225000000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":293200000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":640200000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":432300000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":144000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":134500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":14710000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":12750000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":4833,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":328100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":248500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":589900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":1229000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1229000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":21680000000},"Exports":{"usd":162600000000},"Imports":{"usd":158600000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":853300000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":321400000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":383900000000},"Exchange rates":"Swedish kronor (SEK) per US dollar -","industries":["iron and steel, precision equipment (bearings, radio and telephone parts, armaments), wood pulp and paper products, processed foods, motor vehicles"],"agricultureProducts":["barley","wheat","sugar beets","meat","milk"],"exportCommodities":["machinery 35%","motor vehicles","paper products","pulp and wood","iron and steel products","chemicals"],"exportPartners":["Norway 10.61%","Germany 10.2%","UK 7.45%","Denmark 7.35%","Finland 6.44%","US 6.36%","France 5.05%","Netherlands 4.67%"],"importCommodities":["machinery","petroleum and petroleum products","chemicals","motor vehicles","iron and steel","foodstuffs","clothing"],"importPartners":["Germany 17.9%","Denmark 8.9%","Norway 8.7%","Netherlands 6.17%","UK 5.56%","Finland 5.14%","France 5.06%","China 4.79%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":5146000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":11426000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"highly developed telecommunications infrastructure;
