{"code":"bd","name":"Bermuda","region":"North America","background":"Bermuda was first settled in 1609 by shipwrecked English colonists headed for Virginia. Tourism to the island to escape North American winters first developed in Victorian times. Tourism continues to be important to the island's economy, although international business has overtaken it in recent years. Bermuda has developed into a highly successful offshore financial center. Although a referendum on independence from the UK was soundly defeated in 1995, the present government has reopened debate on the issue.","geo":{"Location":"North America, group of islands in the North Atlantic Ocean, east of South Carolina (US)","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":32,"min":20},"W":{"deg":64,"min":45}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":54,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":54,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"about one-third the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":103,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive fishing zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"low hills separated by fertile depressions","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Town Hill 76 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":"80% (55% developed, 45% rural/open space) (2005)"},"Irrigated land":"NA (2008)","Natural hazards":"hurricanes (June to November)","naturalResources":["limestone","pleasant climate fostering tourism"],"environmentalIssues":["sustainable development"],"climate":["subtropical","mild, humid","gales, strong winds common in winter"],"geographyNote":["consists of about 138 coral islands and islets with ample rainfall, but no rivers or freshwater lakes","some land was leased by the US Government from 1941 to 1995"]},"people":{"Population":68679,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":67,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"15.1% (male 4,304/female 6,040) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":42,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":40.4,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":43.5,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":0.594,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":11.42,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":7.57,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"migrant(s)/1,000 population"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":100,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":0.2,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Major cities - population":"HAMILTON (capital) 12,000 (2009)","Sex ratio":{"at birth":{"quantity":1.015,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years":{"quantity":1.01,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":0.97,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over":{"quantity":0.71,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population":{"quantity":0.94,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":{"quantity":2.47,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":2.57,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"female":{"quantity":2.36,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"}},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":{"quantity":80.71,"unit":"years"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":77.49,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":83.99,"unit":"years"}},"Total fertility rate":{"quantity":1.97,"unit":"children born/woman"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"quantity":0.3,"unit":"%"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":163,"HIV/AIDS - deaths":392,"Nationality":{"noun":"Bermudian(s)","adjective":"Bermudian"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":{"quantity":98,"unit":"%"},"male":{"quantity":98,"unit":"%"},"female":{"quantity":99,"unit":"%"}},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":{"quantity":12,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":12,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":12,"unit":"years"}},"Education expenditures":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"ethnicGroups":["black 54.8%","white 34.1%","mixed 6.4%","other races 4.3%","unspecified 0.4% (2000 census)"],"religions":["Anglican 23%","Roman Catholic 15%","African Methodist Episcopal 11%","other Protestant 18%","other 12%","unaffiliated 6%","unspecified 1%","none 14% (2000 census)"],"languages":["English (official)","Portuguese"]},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"none","conventional short form":"Bermuda","former":"Somers Islands"},"Dependency status":"overseas territory of the UK","Government type":"parliamentary;

Its economy is primarily based on providing financial services for international business and luxury facilities for tourists. A number of reinsurance companies relocated to the island following the 11 September 2001 attacks and again after Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 contributing to the expansion of an already robust international business sector. Bermuda's tourism industry - which derives over 80% of its visitors from the US - continues to struggle but remains the island's number two industry. Most capital equipment and food must be imported. Bermuda's industrial sector is largely focused on construction and agriculture is limited, with only 20% of the land being arable.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":4500000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":"$NA","GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":89,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":38360,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture and fishing":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"laborers":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"clerical":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"},"professional and technical":{"quantity":21,"unit":"%"},"administrative and managerial":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":738000000},"expenditures":{"usd":665000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1360000000},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":675600000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":628300000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":5000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":763000000},"Imports":{"usd":1162000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":160000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Bermudian dollars (BMD) per US dollar - 1.000 (fixed rate pegged to the US dollar)","industries":["international business, tourism, light manufacturing"],"agricultureProducts":["bananas","vegetables","citrus","flowers","dairy products","honey"],"exportCommodities":["reexports of pharmaceuticals"],"exportPartners":["Spain 16.91%","India 10.15%","Brazil 9.55%","Germany 7.4%"],"importCommodities":["clothing","fuels","machinery and transport equipment","construction materials","chemicals","food and live animals"],"importPartners":["US 31.2%","South Korea 26.71%","Brazil 6.77%","Ireland 6.11%","Singapore 5.35%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":57700,"Telephones - mobile cellular":85000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"a good, fully automatic digital telephone system with fiber-optic trunk lines","domestic":"the system has a high fixed-line teledensity coupled with a mobile-cellular teledensity of roughly 125 per 100 persons","international":"country code - 1-441; landing points for the GlobeNet, Gemini Bermuda, and the Challenger Bermuda-1 (CB-1)submarine cables; satellite earth stations - 3 (2009)"},"Broadcast media":"3 television stations; cable and satellite TV subscription services are available; roughly 10 radio stations operating (2007)","Internet country code":".bm","Internet hosts":19855,"Internet users":54000},"transport":{"Airports":1,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":1,"2,438 to 3,047 m":1},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":447,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":447,"unit":"km"}},"Merchant marine":{"total":139,"country comparison to the world":"","by type":"bulk carrier 22, chemical tanker 3, container 15, liquefied gas 38, passenger 26, passenger/cargo 6, petroleum tanker 20, refrigerated cargo 9","foreign-owned":114,"registered in other countries":"180 (Bahamas 12, Cyprus 1, Greece 3, Hong Kong 12, Isle of Man 7, Liberia 4, Malta 8, Marshall Islands 34, Norway 5, Panama 15, Philippines 43, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 1, Singapore 21, UK 9, US 5) (2010)"},"Ports and terminals":"Hamilton, Ireland Island, Saint George"},"military":{"Military branches":"Bermuda Regiment (2009)","Military service age and obligation":"18-30 years of age for voluntary or compulsory enlistment in the Bermuda Regiment; males must register at age 18; term of service is 38 months (2009)","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":15081},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":12323,"females age 16-49":12174},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":433,"female":410},"Military expenditures":{"quantity":0.11,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of the UK"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
