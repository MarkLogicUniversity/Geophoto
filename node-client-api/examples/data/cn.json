{"code":"cn","name":"Comoros","region":"Africa","background":"Comoros has endured more than 20 coups or attempted coups since gaining independence from France in 1975. In 1997, the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared independence from Comoros. In 1999, military chief Col. AZALI seized power in a bloodless coup, and helped negotiate the 2000 Fomboni Accords power-sharing agreement in which the federal presidency rotates among the three islands, and each island maintains its own local government. AZALI won the 2002 presidential election, and each island in the archipelago elected its own president. AZALI stepped down in 2006 and President SAMBI was elected to office. In 2007, Mohamed BACAR effected Anjouan's de-facto secession from the Union, refusing to step down in favor of fresh Anjouanais elections when Comoros' other islands held legitimate elections in July. The African Union (AU) initially attempted to resolve the political crisis by applying sanctions and a naval blockade on Anjouan, but in March 2008, AU and Comoran soldiers seized the island. The move was generally welcomed by the island's inhabitants.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Africa, group of islands at the northern mouth of the Mozambique Channel, about two-thirds of the way between northern Madagascar and northern Mozambique","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":12,"min":10},"E":{"deg":44,"min":15}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":2235,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":2235,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than 12 times the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":340,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"volcanic islands, interiors vary from steep mountains to low hills","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Indian Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Karthala 2,360 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":35.87,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":23.32,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":40.81,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":"NA","Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":0.01,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":13,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"cyclones possible during rainy season (December to April);

The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. Export income is heavily reliant on the three main crops of vanilla, cloves, and ylang-ylang and Comoros' export earnings are easily disrupted by disasters such as fires. The country is not self-sufficient in food production; rice, the main staple, accounts for the bulk of imports. The government - which is hampered by internal political disputes - lacks a comprehensive strategy to attract foreign investment and is struggling to upgrade education and technical training, privatize commercial and industrial enterprises, improve health services, diversify exports, promote tourism, and reduce the high population growth rate. Political problems have inhibited growth, which has averaged only about 1% in 2006-09. Remittances from 150,000 Comorans abroad help supplement GDP. In September 2009 the IMF approved Comoros for a three-year $21 million loan. The IMF gave generally positive reports of the country's program performance as of October 2010. The African Development Bank approved a $34.6 million debt-relief package loan for Comoros in September 2010, and Comoros will attempt to qualify for debt relief in 2012 under the IMF and World Bank's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":800000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":534000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":56,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":268500,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":60,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":55.2,"unit":"%"}},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":27600000},"expenditures":"$NA (2001 est.)"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":2.21,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.5,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":104700000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":168600000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":79750000},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":22000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":20460000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":766.2,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":8000000},"Exports":{"usd":32000000},"Imports":{"usd":143000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":232000000},"Exchange rates":"Comoran francs (KMF) per US dollar -","industries":["fishing, tourism, perfume distillation"],"agricultureProducts":["vanilla","cloves","ylang-ylang (perfume essence)","copra","coconuts","bananas","cassava (tapioca)"],"exportCommodities":["vanilla","ylang-ylang (perfume essence)","cloves","copra"],"exportPartners":["Turkey 25.2%","France 20.44%","Singapore 17.44%","Algeria 8.02%","Italy 6.09%","Saudi Arabia 5%"],"importCommodities":["rice and other foodstuffs","consumer goods","petroleum products","cement","transport equipment"],"importPartners":["France 15.5%","China 14.66%","India 10.55%","UAE 7.88%","Pakistan 5.69%","Kenya 4.51%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":25400,"Telephones - mobile cellular":100000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"sparse system of microwave radio relay and HF radiotelephone communication stations","domestic":"fixed-line connections only about 3 per 100 persons;
