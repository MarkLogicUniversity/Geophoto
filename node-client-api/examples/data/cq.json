The rate of funding has declined as locally generated government revenues have grown. The key tourist industry employs about 50% of the work force and accounts for roughly one-fourth of GDP. Japanese tourists predominate. Annual tourist entries have exceeded one-half million in recent years, but financial difficulties in Japan have caused a temporary slowdown. The agricultural sector is made up of cattle ranches and small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons. Garment production is by far the most important industry with the employment of 17,500 mostly Chinese workers and sizable shipments to the US under duty and quota exemptions.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":900000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":633400000},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":"NA%"},"Labor force":{"Labor force":38450,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":"NA%"},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":193000000},"expenditures":{"usd":223000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"-0.8% (2000)","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":60600,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":48300,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Exports":{"usd":98200000},"Imports":{"usd":214400000},"Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"the US dollar is used","industries":["banking, construction, fishing, garment, tourism, handicrafts"],"agricultureProducts":["vegetables and melons","fruits and nuts","ornamental plants","livestock","poultry and eggs","fish and aquaculture products"],"exportCommodities":["garments"],"importCommodities":["food","construction equipment and materials","petroleum products"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":25100,"Telephones - mobile cellular":20500,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"NA","domestic":"NA","international":"country code - 1-670; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean)"},"Broadcast media":"1 TV broadcast station on Saipan; multi-channel cable TV services are available on Saipan; 9 licensed radio broadcast stations (2009)","Internet country code":".mp","Internet hosts":9},"transport":{"Airports":5,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":3,"2,438 to 3,047 m":2,"1,524 to 2,437 m":1},"Airports - with unpaved runways":{"total":2,"2,438 to 3,047 m":1,"under 914 m":1},"Heliports":1,"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":536,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Ports and terminals":"Saipan, Tinian, Rota"},"military":{"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":8793,"females age 16-49":11569},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":410,"female":306},"Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of the US"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
