{"code":"it","name":"Italy","region":"Europe","background":"Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the forefront of European economic and political unification, joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include illegal immigration, organized crime, corruption, high unemployment, sluggish economic growth, and the low incomes and technical standards of southern Italy compared with the prosperous north.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Europe, a peninsula extending into the central Mediterranean Sea, northeast of Tunisia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":42,"min":50},"E":{"deg":12,"min":50}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":301340,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":294140,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":7200,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Arizona","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1899.2,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Austria 430 km, France 488 km, Holy See (Vatican City) 3.2 km, San Marino 39 km, Slovenia 199 km, Switzerland 740 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":7600,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"mostly rugged and mountainous;

The Italian economy is driven in large part by the manufacture of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and medium-sized enterprises, many of them family owned. Italy also has a sizable underground economy, which by some estimates accounts for as much as 15% of GDP. These activities are most common within the agriculture, construction, and service sectors. Italy has moved slowly on implementing needed structural reforms, such as reducing graft, overhauling costly entitlement programs, and increasing employment opportunities for young workers, particularly women. The international financial crisis worsened conditions in Italy's labor market, with unemployment rising from 6.2% in 2007 to 8.4% in 2010, but in the longer-term Italy's low fertility rate and quota-driven immigration policies will increasingly strain its economy. A rise in exports and investment driven by the global economic recovery nevertheless helped the economy grow by about 1% in 2010 following a 5% contraction in 2009. The Italian government has struggled to limit government spending, but Italy's exceedingly high public debt remains above 115% of GDP, and its fiscal deficit - just 1.5% of GDP in 2007 - exceeded 5% in 2009 and 2010, as the costs of servicing the country's debt rose.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1774000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":2055000000000.0002},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":73.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":25050000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":30.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":65.1,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.4,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":26.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":32,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":940300000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1042000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":118.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.26,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1234000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1884000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":3274000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":317300000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":0.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":289700000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":315000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":3431000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":43000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":146500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1537000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":586900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1911000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":423700000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":8119000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":78120000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":124000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":69240000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":69830000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-61.98 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":458400000000},"Imports":{"usd":459700000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":2223000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":405100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":601100000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, machinery, iron and steel, chemicals, food processing, textiles, motor vehicles, clothing, footwear, ceramics"],"agricultureProducts":["fruits","vegetables","grapes","potatoes","sugar beets","soybeans","grain","olives","beef","dairy products","fish"],"exportCommodities":["engineering products","textiles and clothing","production machinery","motor vehicles","transport equipment","chemicals","food","beverages and tobacco","minerals","and nonferrous metals"],"exportPartners":["Germany 12.6%","France 11.57%","US 5.92%","Spain 5.69%","UK 5.13%","Switzerland 4.69%"],"importCommodities":["engineering products","chemicals","transport equipment","energy products","minerals and nonferrous metals","textiles and clothing","food","beverages","and tobacco"],"importPartners":["Germany 16.68%","France 8.82%","China 6.53%","Netherlands 5.63%","Spain 4.3%","Russia 4.12%","Belgium 4.08%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":21300000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":90613000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern, well developed, fast;
