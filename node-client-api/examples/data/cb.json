{"code":"cb","name":"Cambodia","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"Most Cambodians consider themselves to be Khmers, descendants of the Angkor Empire that extended over much of Southeast Asia and reached its zenith between the 10th and 13th centuries. Attacks by the Thai and Cham (from present-day Vietnam) weakened the empire, ushering in a long period of decline. The king placed the country under French protection in 1863 and it became part of French Indochina in 1887. Following Japanese occupation in World War II, Cambodia gained full independence from France in 1953. In April 1975, after a five-year struggle, Communist Khmer Rouge forces captured Phnom Penh and evacuated all cities and towns. At least 1.5 million Cambodians died from execution, forced hardships, or starvation during the Khmer Rouge regime under POL POT. A December 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge into the countryside, began a 10-year Vietnamese occupation, and touched off almost 13 years of civil war. The 1991 Paris Peace Accords mandated democratic elections and a ceasefire, which was not fully respected by the Khmer Rouge. UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore some semblance of normalcy under a coalition government. Factional fighting in 1997 ended the first coalition government, but a second round of national elections in 1998 led to the formation of another coalition government and renewed political stability. The remaining elements of the Khmer Rouge surrendered in early 1999. Some of the surviving Khmer Rouge leaders have been tried or are awaiting trial for crimes against humanity by a hybrid UN-Cambodian tribunal supported by international assistance. Elections in July 2003 were relatively peaceful, but it took one year of negotiations between contending political parties before a coalition government was formed. In October 2004, King Norodom SIHANOUK abdicated the throne and his son, Prince Norodom SIHAMONI, was selected to succeed him. Local elections were held in Cambodia in April 2007, with little of the pre-election violence that preceded prior elections. National elections in July 2008 were relatively peaceful.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Asia, bordering the Gulf of Thailand, between Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":13,"min":0},"E":{"deg":105,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":181035,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":176515,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":4520,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

GDP contracted slightly in 2009 as a result of the global economic slowdown, but climbed more than 4% in 1010, driven by renewed exports. With the January 2005 expiration of a WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, Cambodian textile producers were forced to compete directly with lower-priced countries such as China, India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. The garment industry currently employs more than 280,000 people - about 5% of the work force - and contributes more than 70% of Cambodia's exports. In 2005, exploitable oil deposits were found beneath Cambodia's territorial waters, representing a new revenue stream for the government if commercial extraction begins. Mining also is attracting significant investor interest, particularly in the northern parts of the country. The government has said opportunities exist for mining bauxite, gold, iron and gems. In 2006, a US-Cambodia bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) was signed, and several rounds of discussions have been held since 2007. Rubber exports increased about 25% in 2009 due to rising global demand. The tourism industry has continued to grow rapidly, with foreign arrivals exceeding 2 million per year in 2007-08; however, economic troubles abroad dampened growth in 2009. The global financial crisis is weakening demand for Cambodian exports, and construction is declining due to a shortage of credit. The long-term development of the economy remains a daunting challenge. The Cambodian government is working with bilateral and multilateral donors, including the World Bank and IMF, to address the country's many pressing needs. The major economic challenge for Cambodia over the next decade will be fashioning an economic environment in which the private sector can create enough jobs to handle Cambodia's demographic imbalance. More than 50% of the population is less than 25 years old. The population lacks education and productive skills, particularly in the poverty-ridden countryside, which suffers from an almost total lack of basic infrastructure.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":30180000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":11630000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":33.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":21.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":45.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":8800000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":57.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":15.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":26.5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":31,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":34.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":43,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":23,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1413000000},"expenditures":{"usd":2079000000.0000002}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA% (31 December 2008)","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":850700000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4982000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2195000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1273000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":1272000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":167000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":4000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":30970,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-918 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":4687000000},"Imports":{"usd":6005000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3840000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":4338000000},"Exchange rates":"riels (KHR) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, garments, construction, rice milling, fishing, wood and wood products, rubber, cement, gem mining, textiles"],"agricultureProducts":["rice","rubber","corn","vegetables","cashews","tapioca","silk"],"exportCommodities":["clothing","timber","rubber","rice","fish","tobacco","footwear"],"exportPartners":["US 45.32%","Singapore 9.46%","Germany 7.52%","UK 7.07%","Canada 6.31%","Vietnam 4.15%"],"importCommodities":["petroleum products","cigarettes","gold","construction materials","machinery","motor vehicles","pharmaceutical products"],"importPartners":["Thailand 24.83%","Vietnam 19.73%","China 14.08%","Singapore 11.34%","Hong Kong 7.41%","Taiwan 5.1%","South Korea 4.06%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":54200,"Telephones - mobile cellular":5593000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"adequate fixed-line and/or cellular service in Phnom Penh and other provincial cities;
