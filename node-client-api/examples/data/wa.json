Namibia has been governed by SWAPO since the country won independence in 1990.

Mining accounts for 8% of GDP, but provides more than 50% of foreign exchange earnings. Rich alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia is the world's fourth-largest producer of uranium. It also produces large quantities of zinc and is a small producer of gold and other minerals. The mining sector employs only about 3% of the population while about 35-40% of the population depends on subsistence agriculture for its livelihood. Namibia normally imports about 50% of its cereal requirements; in drought years food shortages are a major problem in rural areas. A high per capita GDP, relative to the region, hides one of the world's most unequal income distributions, as shown by Namibia's 70.7 GINI coefficient. The Namibian economy is closely linked to South Africa with the Namibian dollar pegged one-to-one to the South African rand. Until 2010, Namibia drew 40% of its budget revenues from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). Increased payments from SACU put Namibia's budget into surplus in 2007 for the first time since independence. SACU allotments to Namibia increased in 2009, but will drop for 2010 and 2011 because South Africa went into recession during the global economic crisis, reducing overall SACU income. Increased fish production and mining of zinc, copper, and uranium spurred growth in 2003-08, but growth in recent years was undercut by poor fish catches, a dramatic decline in demand for diamonds, higher costs of producing metals, and the global recession. A rebound in diamond and uranium prices in 2010 provided a significant boost to Namibia's mining sector. Copper mines, which closed in 2008, are slated to reopen in 2011.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":14600000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":11870000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":32.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":58.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":729000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":16.3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":22.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":61.3,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":51.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":55.8,"unit":"%"}},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":53,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":70.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":24,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":2977000000},"expenditures":{"usd":3817000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":20,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.12,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":3049000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4756000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":5122000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":846300000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1491000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2845000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":40000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":2045000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":22000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":19120,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":62290000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-187 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":4277000000},"Imports":{"usd":5152000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1961000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2373000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Namibian dollars (NAD) per US dollar -","industries":["meatpacking, fish processing, dairy products","mining (diamonds, lead, zinc, tin, silver, tungsten, uranium, copper)"],"agricultureProducts":["millet","sorghum","peanuts","grapes","livestock","fish"],"exportCommodities":["diamonds","copper","gold","zinc","lead","uranium","cattle","processed fish","karakul skins"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","petroleum products and fuel","machinery and equipment","chemicals"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":142100,"Telephones - mobile cellular":1217000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"good system;
