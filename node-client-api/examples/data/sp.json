{"code":"sp","name":"Spain","region":"Europe","background":"Spain's powerful world empire of the 16th and 17th centuries ultimately yielded command of the seas to England. Subsequent failure to embrace the mercantile and industrial revolutions caused the country to fall behind Britain, France, and Germany in economic and political power. Spain remained neutral in World Wars I and II but suffered through a devastating civil war (1936-39). A peaceful transition to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco FRANCO in 1975, and rapid economic modernization (Spain joined the EU in 1986) gave Spain a dynamic and rapidly growing economy and made it a global champion of freedom and human rights. The government continues to battle the Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) terrorist organization, but its major focus for the immediate future will be on measures to reverse the severe economic recession that started in mid-2008.","geo":{"Location":"Southwestern Europe, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, North Atlantic Ocean, Bay of Biscay, and Pyrenees Mountains;

However, after almost 15 years of above average GDP growth, the Spanish economy began to slow in late 2007 and entered into a recession in the second quarter of 2008. GDP contracted by 3.7% in 2009, ending a 16-year growth trend, and by another 0.2% in 2010, making Spain the last major economy to emerge from the global recession. The reversal in Spain's economic growth reflected a significant decline in construction amid an oversupply of housing and falling consumer spending, while exports actually have begun to grow. Government efforts to boost the economy through stimulus spending, extended unemployment benefits, and loan guarantees did not prevent a sharp rise in the unemployment rate, which rose from a low of about 8% in 2007 to 20% in 2010. The government budget deficit worsened from 3.8% of GDP in 2008 to about 9.7% of GDP in 2010, more than three times the euro-zone limit. Spain's large budget deficit and poor economic growth prospects have made it vulnerable to financial contagion from other highly-indebted euro zone members despite the government's efforts to cut spending, privatize industries, and boost competitiveness through labor market reforms. Spanish banks' high exposure to the collapsed domestic construction and real estate market also poses a continued risk for the sector. The government oversaw a restructuring of the savings bank sector in 2010, and provided some $15 billion in capital to various institutions. Investors remain concerned that Madrid may need to bail out more troubled banks. The Bank of Spain, however, is seeking to boost confidence in the financial sector by pressuring banks to come clean about their losses and consolidate into stronger groups.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1369000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1410000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-0.1% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":25.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":71.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":22960000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":71.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":19.8,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":26.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":32,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":515799999999.99994},"expenditures":{"usd":648600000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":63.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.72,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":849200000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2264000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":3683000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1297000000000},"Industrial production growth rate":"-2% (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":300500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":276100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":16920000000.000002,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":5880000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":27230,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1482000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":218600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1716000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":150000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":13000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":33880000000.000004,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":975000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":34670000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":2548000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-66.74 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":268300000000},"Imports":{"usd":324600000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":2166000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":668500000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":641000000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["textiles and apparel (including footwear), food and beverages, metals and metal manufactures, chemicals, shipbuilding, automobiles, machine tools, tourism, clay and refractory products, footwear, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment"],"agricultureProducts":["grain","vegetables","olives","wine grapes","sugar beets","citrus","beef","pork","poultry","dairy products","fish"],"exportCommodities":["machinery","motor vehicles","foodstuffs","pharmaceuticals","medicines","other consumer goods"],"exportPartners":["France 19.27%","Germany 11.11%","Portugal 9.21%","Italy 8.24%","UK 6.18%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","fuels","chemicals","semifinished goods","foodstuffs","consumer goods","measuring and medical control instruments"],"importPartners":["Germany 15.02%","France 12.82%","Italy 7.17%","China 5.8%","Netherlands 5.22%","UK 4.7%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":20057000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":50991000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"well developed, modern facilities;
