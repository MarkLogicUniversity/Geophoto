In 1932, French Indochina annexed the islands and set up a weather station on Pattle Island; maintenance was continued by its successor, Vietnam. China has occupied the Paracel Islands since 1974, when its troops seized a South Vietnamese garrison occupying the western islands. China built a military installation on Woody Island with an airfield and artificial harbor. The islands also are claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Asia, group of small islands and reefs in the South China Sea, about one-third of the way from central Vietnam to the northern Philippines","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":16,"min":30},"E":{"deg":112,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":"ca. 7.75 sq km","land":"ca. 7.75 sq km","water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"NA","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":518,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"NA","Terrain":"mostly low and flat","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"South China Sea 0 m","highest point":"unnamed location on Rocky Island 14 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"},"Natural hazards":"typhoons","naturalResources":["none"],"environmentalIssues":["NA"],"climate":["tropical"],"geographyNote":["composed of 130 small coral islands and reefs divided into the northeast Amphitrite Group and the western Crescent Group"]},"people":{"Population":{"Population":"no indigenous inhabitants"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":"NA"},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"none","conventional short form":"Paracel Islands"}},"economy":{"Economy - overview":"The islands have the potential for oil and gas development.
