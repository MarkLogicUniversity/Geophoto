{"code":"no","name":"Norway","region":"Europe","background":"Two centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off following the adoption of Christianity by King Olav TRYGGVASON in 994. Conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next several decades. In 1397, Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four centuries. In 1814, Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution. Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a Swedish king. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Although Norway remained neutral in World War I, it suffered heavy losses to its shipping. Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II, but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany (1940-45). In 1949, neutrality was abandoned and Norway became a member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. In referenda held in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining the EU. Key domestic issues include immigration and integration of ethnic minorities, maintaining the country's extensive social safety net with an aging population, and preserving economic competitiveness.","geo":{"Location":"Northern Europe, bordering the North Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, west of Sweden","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":62,"min":0},"E":{"deg":10,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":323802,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":304282,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":19520,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

The government controls key areas, such as the vital petroleum sector, through large-scale state-majority-owned enterprises. The country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on the petroleum sector, which accounts for nearly half of exports and over 30% of state revenue. Norway is the world's second-largest gas exporter; its position as an oil exporter has slipped to ninth-largest as production has begun to decline. Norway opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in November 1994; nonetheless, as a member of the European Economic Area, it contributes sizably to the EU budget. In anticipation of eventual declines in oil and gas production, Norway saves state revenue from the petroleum sector in the world's second largest sovereign wealth fund, valued at over $500 billion in 2010. After solid GDP growth in 2004-07, the economy slowed in 2008, and contracted in 2009, before returning to positive growth in 2010.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":255300000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":414500000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":40.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":57.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2590000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":21.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":76,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":21,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":25,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":226800000000},"expenditures":{"usd":187000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":47.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":4.28,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":122200000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":256300000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":414500000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":227200000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":0.3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":142700000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":128800000000.00002,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":17290000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":3414000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":2350000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":204100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2150000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":107500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":6680000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":103500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":4620000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":98850000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":2313000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":60230000000},"Exports":{"usd":137000000000},"Imports":{"usd":74020000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"Debt - external":{"usd":2232000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":132800000000.00002},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":226600000000},"Exchange rates":"Norwegian kroner (NOK) per US dollar -","industries":["petroleum and gas, food processing, shipbuilding, pulp and paper products, metals, chemicals, timber, mining, textiles, fishing"],"agricultureProducts":["barley","wheat","potatoes","pork","beef","veal","milk","fish"],"exportCommodities":["petroleum and petroleum products","machinery and equipment","metals","chemicals","ships","fish"],"exportPartners":["UK 24.28%","Germany 13.4%","Netherlands 10.87%","France 8.55%","Sweden 5.76%","US 4.82%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","chemicals","metals","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["Sweden 13.86%","Germany 12.89%","China 7.8%","Denmark 6.78%","US 6.16%","UK 6.01%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1900000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":5336000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern in all respects;
