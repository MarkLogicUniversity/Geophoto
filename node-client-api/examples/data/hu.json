{"code":"hu","name":"Hungary","region":"Europe","background":"Hungary became a Christian kingdom in A.D. 1000 and for many centuries served as a bulwark against Ottoman Turkish expansion in Europe. The kingdom eventually became part of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed during World War I. The country fell under Communist rule following World War II. In 1956, a revolt and an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met with a massive military intervention by Moscow. Under the leadership of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary began liberalizing its economy, introducing so-called \"Goulash Communism.\" Hungary held its first multiparty elections in 1990 and initiated a free market economy. It joined NATO in 1999 and the EU five years later. In 2011, Hungary assumed the six-month rotating presidency of the EU for the first time.","geo":{"Location":"Central Europe, northwest of Romania","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":47,"min":0},"E":{"deg":20,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":93028,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":89608,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":3420,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

overview":"Hungary has made the transition from a centrally planned to a market economy, with a per capita income nearly two-thirds that of the EU-25 average. The private sector accounts for more than 80% of GDP. Foreign ownership of and investment in Hungarian firms are widespread, with cumulative foreign direct investment worth more than $70 billion. The government's austerity measures, imposed since late 2006, have reduced the budget deficit from over 9% of GDP in 2006 to 3.2% in 2010, with a target of less than 3% in 2011. Hungary's impending inability to service its short-term debt - brought on by the global financial crisis in late 2008 - led Budapest to obtain an IMF/EU/World Bank-arranged financial assistance package worth over $25 billion. The global economic downturn, declining exports, and low domestic consumption and fixed asset accumulation, dampened by government austerity measures, resulted in an economic contraction of 6.3% in 2009. In 2010 the new government implemented a number of changes including cutting business and personal income taxes, but imposed \"crisis taxes\" on financial institutions, energy and telecom companies, and retailers. The economy rebounded in 2010 with a big boost from exports, especially to Germany, and growth of more than 2.5% is expected in 2011. Unemployment remained high, at more than 10% in 2010.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":187600000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":129000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":30.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":65.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4300000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":30.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":64.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":10.7,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":13.9,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":22.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":24.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":63100000000},"expenditures":{"usd":67310000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":79.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":5.75,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":7.1,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":31810000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":68870000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":108100000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":27880000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":37550000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":42700000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":4703000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":9879000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":21430,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":137300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":171600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":26570000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":2609000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":11050000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":227000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":9630000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":8098000000.000001,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.128 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":93740000000},"Imports":{"usd":87440000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":44990000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":148400000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":82070000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":19800000000},"Exchange rates":"forints (HUF) per US dollar -","industries":["mining, metallurgy, construction materials, processed foods, textiles, chemicals (especially pharmaceuticals), motor vehicles"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","corn","sunflower seed","potatoes","sugar beets","pigs","cattle","poultry","dairy products"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and equipment 61.1%","other manufactures 28.7%","food products 6.5%","raw materials 2%","fuels and electricity 1.6% (2009 est.)"],"exportPartners":["Germany 25.5%","Italy 5.5%","UK 5.4%","Romania 5.3%","Slovakia 5.1%","France 4.9%","Austria 4.7% (2010 est.)"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment 50%","fuels and electricity 11%","food products","raw materials"],"importPartners":["Germany 26.1%","Russia 7.7%","China 6.8%","Austria 5.9%","Netherlands 4.4%","Poland 4.3%","Italy 4.2% (2010 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":3069000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":11793000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"the telephone system has been modernized;
