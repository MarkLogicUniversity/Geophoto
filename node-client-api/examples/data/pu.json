{"code":"pu","name":"Guinea-Bissau","region":"Africa","background":"Since independence from Portugal in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has experienced considerable political and military upheaval. In 1980, a military coup established authoritarian dictator Joao Bernardo 'Nino' VIEIRA as president. Despite setting a path to a market economy and multiparty system, VIEIRA's regime was characterized by the suppression of political opposition and the purging of political rivals. Several coup attempts through the 1980s and early 1990s failed to unseat him. In 1994 VIEIRA was elected president in the country's first free elections. A military mutiny and resulting civil war in 1998 eventually led to VIEIRA's ouster in May 1999. In February 2000, a transitional government turned over power to opposition leader Kumba YALA after he was elected president in transparent polling. In September 2003, after only three years in office, YALA was ousted by the military in a bloodless coup, and businessman Henrique ROSA was sworn in as interim president. In 2005, former President VIEIRA was re-elected president pledging to pursue economic development and national reconciliation; he was assassinated in March 2009. Malam Bacai SANHA was elected in an emergency election held in June 2009.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Guinea and Senegal","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":12,"min":0},"W":{"deg":15,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":36125,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":28120,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":8005,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than three times the size of Connecticut","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":724,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Guinea 386 km, Senegal 338 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":350,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"mostly low coastal plain rising to savanna in east","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"unnamed elevation in the eastern part of the country 300 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":8.31,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":6.92,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":84.77,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":250,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":31,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":0.18,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":113,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"hot, dry, dusty harmattan haze may reduce visibility during dry season;

Cashew crops have increased remarkably in recent years. Guinea-Bissau exports fish and seafood along with small amounts of peanuts, palm kernels, and timber. Rice is the major crop and staple food. However, intermittent fighting between Senegalese-backed government troops and a military junta destroyed much of the country's infrastructure and caused widespread damage to the economy in 1998; the civil war led to a 28% drop in GDP that year, with partial recovery in 1999-2002. In December 2003, the World Bank, IMF, and UNDP were forced to step in to provide emergency budgetary support in the amount of $107 million for 2004, representing over 80% of the total national budget. The combination of limited economic prospects, a weak and faction-ridden government, and favorable geography have made this West African country a way station for drugs bound for Europe.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1784000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":837000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":62,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":632700,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":82,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":28,"unit":"%"}},"Budget":{"revenues":"$NA","expenditures":"$NA"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":192100000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":209300000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":42560000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4.7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":65000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":60450000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":3000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2545,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-6 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":133000000},"Imports":{"usd":200000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":941500000},"Exchange rates":"Communaute Financiere Africaine francs (XOF) per US dollar -","industries":["agricultural products processing, beer, soft drinks"],"agricultureProducts":["rice","corn","beans","cassava (tapioca)","cashew nuts","peanuts","palm kernels","cotton","timber","fish"],"exportCommodities":["fish","shrimp","cashew nuts","peanuts","palm kernels","sawn lumber"],"exportPartners":["India 62.21%","Nigeria 31.28%","Portugal 1.48%"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","machinery and transport equipment","petroleum products"],"importPartners":["Portugal 17.33%","Senegal 13.66%","Netherlands 9.27%","India 9.11%","Thailand 5.2%","Brazil 4.49%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":4800,"Telephones - mobile cellular":560300,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"small system including a combination of microwave radio relay, open-wire lines, radiotelephone, and mobile-cellular communications","domestic":"fixed-line teledensity less than 1 per 100 persons;
