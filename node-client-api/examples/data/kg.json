{"code":"kg","name":"Kyrgyzstan","region":"Central Asia","background":"A Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions, most of Kyrgyzstan was formally annexed to Russia in 1876. The Kyrgyz staged a major revolt against the Tsarist Empire in 1916 in which almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz population was killed. Kyrgyzstan became a Soviet republic in 1936 and achieved independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved. Nationwide demonstrations in the spring of 2005 resulted in the ouster of President Askar AKAEV, who had run the country since 1990. Subsequent presidential elections in July 2005 were won overwhelmingly by former prime minister Kurmanbek BAKIEV. Over the next few years, the new president manipulated the parliament to accrue new powers for himself. In July 2009, after months of harassment against his opponents and media critics, BAKIEV won re-election in a presidential campaign that the international community deemed flawed. In April 2010, nationwide protests led to the resignation and expulsion of BAKIEV. He was replaced by President Roza OTUNBAEVA who will serve as president until 31 December 2011 according to a presidential decree issued 19 May 2010. Presidential elections are scheduled to be held in October 2011. Continuing concerns include: endemic corruption, poor interethnic relations, and terrorism.","geo":{"Location":"Central Asia, west of China, south of Kazakhstan","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":41,"min":0},"E":{"deg":75,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":199951,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":191801,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":8150,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

overview":"Kyrgyzstan is a poor, mountainous country with a dominant agricultural sector. Cotton, tobacco, wool, and meat are the main agricultural products, although only tobacco and cotton are exported in any quantity. Industrial exports include gold, mercury, uranium, natural gas, and electricity. The economy depends heavily on gold exports - mainly from output at the Kumtor gold mine. Following independence, Kyrgyzstan was progressive in carrying out market reforms, such as an improved regulatory system and land reform. Kyrgyzstan was the first Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) country to be accepted into the World Trade Organization. Much of the government's stock in enterprises has been sold. Drops in production had been severe after the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1991, but by mid-1995, production began to recover and exports began to increase. In 2005, the BAKIEV government and international financial institutions initiated a comprehensive medium-term poverty reduction and economic growth strategy. Bishkek agreed to pursue much needed tax reform and, in 2006, became eligible for the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. The government made steady strides in controlling its substantial fiscal deficit, nearly closing the gap between revenues and expenditures in 2006, before boosting expenditures more than 20% in 2007-08. GDP grew about 8% annually in 2007-08, partly due to higher gold prices internationally, but slowed to 2.3% in 2009. The overthrow of President BAKIEV in April, 2010 and subsequent ethnic clashes left hundreds dead and damaged infrastructure. Shrinking trade and agricultural production, as well as political instability, caused GDP to contract about 3.5% in 2010. The fiscal deficit widened to 11% of GDP, reflecting significant increases in crisis-related spending, including both rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure and bank recapitalization. Progress in reconstruction, fighting corruption, restructuring domestic industry, and attracting foreign aid and investment are key to future growth.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":12020000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":4615000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-1.4% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":24.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":50.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2344000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":48,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":12.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":39.5,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":25.9,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":30.3,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":26.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":980000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1460000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":9.07,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":23.03,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":714900000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1100000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":505400000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":71840000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":15960000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":9000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":2379000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":979.1,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":15000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1890,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":12850,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":40000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":30000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":750000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":720000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":5663000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-210 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1682000000},"Imports":{"usd":3075000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1615000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":3738000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA (31 December 2009 est.)","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"soms (KGS) per US dollar -","industries":["small machinery, textiles, food processing, cement, shoes, sawn logs, refrigerators, furniture, electric motors, gold, rare earth metals"],"agricultureProducts":["tobacco","cotton","potatoes","vegetables","grapes","fruits and berries","sheep","goats","cattle","wool"],"exportCommodities":["cotton","wool","meat","tobacco","gold","mercury","uranium","natural gas","hydropower","machinery","shoes"],"exportPartners":["Switzerland 25.96%","Russia 25.88%","Uzbekistan 15.72%","Kazakhstan 12.47%"],"importCommodities":["oil and gas","machinery and equipment","chemicals","foodstuffs"],"importPartners":["China 57.03%","Russia 19.34%","Kazakhstan 5.9%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":498300,"Telephones - mobile cellular":4487000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"telecommunications infrastructure is being upgraded;
