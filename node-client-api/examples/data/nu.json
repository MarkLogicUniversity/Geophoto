{"code":"nu","name":"Nicaragua","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"The Pacific coast of Nicaragua was settled as a Spanish colony from Panama in the early 16th century. Independence from Spain was declared in 1821 and the country became an independent republic in 1838. Britain occupied the Caribbean Coast in the first half of the 19th century, but gradually ceded control of the region in subsequent decades. Violent opposition to governmental manipulation and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and resulted in a short-lived civil war that brought the Marxist Sandinista guerrillas to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels in El Salvador caused the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra guerrillas through much of the 1980s. After losing free and fair elections in 1990, 1996, and 2001, former Sandinista President Daniel ORTEGA Saavedra was elected president in 2006. The 2008 municipal elections were marred by widespread irregularities. Nicaragua's infrastructure and economy - hard hit by the earlier civil war and by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 - are slowly being rebuilt, but democratic institutions have been weakened under the ORTEGA administration.","geo":{"Location":"Central America, bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Pacific Ocean, between Costa Rica and Honduras","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":13,"min":0},"W":{"deg":85,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":130370,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":119990,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":10380,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than New York state","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1231,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Costa Rica 309 km, Honduras 922 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":910,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"natural prolongation"},"Terrain":"extensive Atlantic coastal plains rising to central interior mountains;

The US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) has been in effect since April 2006 and has expanded export opportunities for many agricultural and manufactured goods. Textiles and apparel account for nearly 60% of Nicaragua's exports, but increases in the minimum wage during the ORTEGA administration will likely erode its comparative advantage in this industry. ORTEGA's promotion of mixed business initiatives, owned by the Nicaraguan and Venezuelan state oil firms, together with the weak rule of law, could undermine the investment climate for domestic and international private firms in the near-term. Nicaragua relies on international economic assistance to meet internal- and external-debt financing obligations. Foreign donors have curtailed this funding, however, in response to November 2008 electoral fraud. Managua has an IMF extended Credit Facility program, which could help keep the government's fiscal deficit on target during the 2011 election year and encourage transparency in the use of Venezuelan off-budget loans and assistance. In early 2004, Nicaragua secured some $4.5 billion in foreign debt reduction under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, however, Managua still struggles with a high public debt burden. Nicaragua is gradually recovering from the global economic crisis as increased exports drove positive growth in 2010. The economy is expected to grow at a rate of about 3% in 2011.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":17710000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":6551000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":17.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":26.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":56,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2343000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":28,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":53,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":48,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":41.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":43.1,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1421000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1511000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":78,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA% (31 December 2009)","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":14.04,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1273000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2900000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":4083000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":3286000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2569000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":63950000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":29000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":212.5,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":29570,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-819 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":3182000000},"Imports":{"usd":4700000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1580000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":4030000000.0000005},"Exchange rates":"cordobas (NIO) per US dollar -","industries":["food processing, chemicals, machinery and metal products, knit and woven apparel, petroleum refining and distribution, beverages, footwear, wood"],"agricultureProducts":["coffee","bananas","sugarcane","cotton","rice","corn","tobacco","sesame","soya","beans","beef","veal","pork","poultry","dairy products","shrimp","lobsters"],"exportCommodities":["coffee","beef","shrimp and lobster","tobacco","sugar","gold","peanuts","textiles and apparel"],"exportPartners":["US 61.98%","El Salvador 7.74%","Costa Rica 3.67%"],"importCommodities":["consumer goods","machinery and equipment","raw materials","petroleum products"],"importPartners":["US 22.63%","Venezuela 12.27%","Mexico 9.05%","Costa Rica 8.66%","China 7.16%","Guatemala 6.59%","El Salvador 5.63%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":255000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":3204000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"system being upgraded by foreign investment;
