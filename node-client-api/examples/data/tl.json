New Zealand's support amounts to 80% of Tokelau's recurrent government budget. An international trust fund, currently worth nearly US$32 million, was established in 2004 to provide Tokelau an independent source of revenue. The principal sources of revenue come from sales of copra, postage stamps, souvenir coins, and handicrafts. Money is also remitted to families from relatives in New Zealand.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1500000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":"$NA","GDP - real growth rate":"NA%","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":"NA%"},"Labor force":440,"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":"NA%","Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":null},"expenditures":{"usd":2800000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"NA%","Electricity - production":"NA kWh","Electricity - consumption":"NA kWh","Exports":{"usd":null},"Imports":{"usd":null},"Exchange rates":"New Zealand dollars (NZD) per US dollar -","industries":["small-scale enterprises for copra production, woodworking, plaited craft goods","stamps, coins","fishing"],"agricultureProducts":["coconuts","copra","breadfruit","papayas","bananas","pigs","poultry","goats","fish"],"exportCommodities":["stamps","copra","handicrafts"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","building materials","fuel"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":300,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern satellite-based communications system","domestic":"radiotelephone service between islands","international":"country code - 690; radiotelephone service to Samoa; government-regulated telephone service (TeleTok); satellite earth stations - 3"},"Broadcast media":"no broadcast television stations; each atoll operates a radio service that provides shipping news and weather reports (2009)","Internet country code":".tk","Internet hosts":526,"Internet users":800},"transport":{"Ports and terminals":"none; offshore anchorage only"},"military":{"Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of New Zealand"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["Tokelau included American Samoa's Swains Island (Olohega) in its 2006 draft independence constitution"]}}
