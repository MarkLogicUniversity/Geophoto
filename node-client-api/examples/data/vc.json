Much of the workforce is employed in banana production and tourism, but persistent high unemployment has prompted many to leave the islands. This lower-middle-income country is vulnerable to natural disasters - tropical storms wiped out substantial portions of crops in 1994, 1995, and 2002. In 2008, the islands had more than 200,000 tourist arrivals, mostly to the Grenadines, a drop of nearly 20% from 2007. Saint Vincent is home to a small offshore banking sector and has moved to adopt international regulatory standards. The government's ability to invest in social programs and respond to external shocks is constrained by its high public debt burden, which was over 90% of GDP at the end of 2010. Following the global downturn, St. Vincent and the Grenadines saw an economic decline in 2009, after slowing since 2006, when GDP growth reached a 10-year high of nearly 7%. The GONSALVES administration is directing government resources to infrastructure projects, including a new international airport that is expected to be completed in 2011.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1069000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":561000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-2.3% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":64,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":57520,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":57,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":192200000},"expenditures":{"usd":218100000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":0.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":9.19,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":133000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":444400000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":417400000},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":133800000.00000001,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":124400000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1451,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-149 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":193000000},"Imports":{"usd":578000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":479000000},"Exchange rates":"East Caribbean dollars (XCD) per US dollar -","industries":["food processing, cement, furniture, clothing, starch"],"agricultureProducts":["bananas","coconuts","sweet potatoes","spices","small numbers of cattle","sheep","pigs","goats","fish"],"exportCommodities":["bananas","eddoes and dasheen (taro)","arrowroot starch","tennis racquets"],"exportPartners":["Greece 40.04%","Poland 11.78%","France 9.05%","China 8.53%","India 4.71%"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","machinery and equipment","chemicals and fertilizers","minerals and fuels"],"importPartners":["Singapore 16.16%","Trinidad and Tobago 13.71%","US 13.41%","China 10.9%","Italy 8.89%","Turkey 6.6%","France 5.64%","Romania 4.44%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":23000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":121100,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"adequate islandwide, fully automatic telephone system","domestic":"fixed-line teledensity exceeds 20 per 100 persons and mobile-cellular teledensity exceeds 100 per 100 persons","international":"country code - 1-784;
