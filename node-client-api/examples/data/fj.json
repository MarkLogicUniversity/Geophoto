{"code":"fj","name":"Fiji","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"Fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a British colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). The coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian control of Fiji led to heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in economic difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians became the majority. A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a civilian-led coup in May 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil. Parliamentary elections held in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia QARASE. Re-elected in May 2006, QARASE was ousted in a December 2006 military coup led by Commodore Voreqe BAINIMARAMA, who initially appointed himself acting president but in January 2007 became interim prime minister. Since taking power BAINIMARAMA has neutralized his opponents, crippled Fiji's democratic institutions, and refused to hold elections.","geo":{"Location":"Oceania, island group in the South Pacific Ocean, about two-thirds of the way from Hawaii to New Zealand","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":18,"min":0},"E":{"deg":175,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":18274,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":18274,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than New Jersey","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1129,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"Maritime claims":"measured from claimed archipelagic straight baselines","territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation;

Sugar exports, remittances from Fijians working abroad, and a growing tourist industry - with 400,000 to 500,000 tourists annually - are the major sources of foreign exchange. Fiji's sugar has special access to European Union markets but will be harmed by the EU's decision to cut sugar subsidies. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial activity but is not efficient. Fiji's tourism industry was damaged by the December 2006 coup and is facing an uncertain recovery time. In 2007 tourist arrivals were down almost 6%, with substantial job losses in the service sector, and GDP dipped. The coup has created a difficult business climate. The EU has suspended all aid until the interim government takes steps toward new elections. Long-term problems include low investment, uncertain land ownership rights, and the government's inability to manage its budget. Overseas remittances from Fijians working in Kuwait and Iraq have decreased significantly. Fiji's current account deficit reached 23% of GDP in 2006.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":3869000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":3131000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":8.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":13.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":77.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":335000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.6,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":25.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1363000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1376000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":7.85,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":748000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1760000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1799000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2009)","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":928000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":863000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":11000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2455,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":20340,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-507 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1202000000},"Imports":{"usd":3120000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":127000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Fijian dollars (FJD) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, sugar, clothing, copra, gold, silver, lumber, small cottage industries"],"agricultureProducts":["sugarcane","coconuts","cassava (tapioca)","rice","sweet potatoes","bananas","cattle","pigs","horses","goats","fish"],"exportCommodities":["sugar","garments","gold","timber","fish","molasses","coconut oil"],"exportPartners":["US 15.21%","Australia 12.11%","UK 11.23%","Samoa 5.39%","Tonga 4.74%","Japan 4.44%"],"importCommodities":["manufactured goods","machinery and transport equipment","petroleum products","food","chemicals"],"importPartners":["Singapore 27.27%","Australia 19.36%","NZ 15.15%","China 6.92%","India 5.23%","Thailand 4.25%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":136800,"Telephones - mobile cellular":640000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern local, interisland, and international (wire/radio integrated) public and special-purpose telephone, telegraph, and teleprinter facilities;
