{"code":"fi","name":"Finland","region":"Europe","background":"Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden from the 12th to the 19th centuries, and an autonomous grand duchy of Russia after 1809. It won its complete independence in 1917. During World War II, it was able to successfully defend its freedom and resist invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of territory. In the subsequent half century, the Finns made a remarkable transformation from a farm/forest economy to a diversified modern industrial economy; per capita income is now among the highest in Western Europe. A member of the European Union since 1995, Finland was the only Nordic state to join the euro system at its initiation in January 1999. In the 21st century, the key features of Finland's modern welfare state are a high standard of education, equality promotion, and national social security system - currently challenged by an aging population and the fluctuations of an export-driven economy.","geo":{"Location":"Northern Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea, Gulf of Bothnia, and Gulf of Finland, between Sweden and Russia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":64,"min":0},"E":{"deg":26,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":338145,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":303815,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":34330,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

Trade is important with exports accounting for over one third of GDP in recent years. Finland is strongly competitive in manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, engineering, telecommunications, and electronics industries. Finland excels in high-tech exports such as mobile phones. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Because of the climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an important export earner, provides a secondary occupation for the rural population. Finland had been one of the best performing economies within the EU in recent years and its banks and financial markets avoided the worst of global financial crisis. However, the world slowdown hit exports and domestic demand hard in 2009, with Finland experiencing one of the deepest contractions in the euro zone. A recovery of exports, domestic trade, and household consumption stimulated economic growth in 2010. The recession left a deep mark on general government finances and the debt ratio, turning previously strong budget surpluses into deficits. Despite good growth prospects, general government finances will remain in deficit during the next few years. The great challenge of economic policy will be to implement a post-recession exit strategy in which measures supporting growth will be combined with general government adjustment measures. Longer-term, Finland must address a rapidly aging population and decreasing productivity that threaten competitiveness, fiscal sustainability, and economic growth.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":186000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":239200000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":29.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":68.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2680000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture and forestry":{"quantity":4.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":16.7,"unit":"%"},"construction":{"quantity":7.1,"unit":"%"},"commerce":{"quantity":19.4,"unit":"%"},"finance, insurance, and business services":{"quantity":12.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.4,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":24.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26.8,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":66580000000},"expenditures":{"usd":65330000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":45.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":3.51,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":108000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":160400000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":259200000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":91020000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":77440000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":87250000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":3335000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":16110000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":8718,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":206200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":130500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":337900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":"NA","Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":4288999999.9999995,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":4288999999.9999995,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":4696000000},"Exports":{"usd":73530000000},"Imports":{"usd":69110000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":9128000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":370800000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":87990000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":122200000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["metals and metal products, electronics, machinery and scientific instruments, shipbuilding, pulp and paper, foodstuffs, chemicals, textiles, clothing"],"agricultureProducts":["barley","wheat","sugar beets","potatoes","dairy cattle","fish"],"exportCommodities":["electrical and optical equipment","machinery","transport equipment","paper and pulp","chemicals","basic metals","timber"],"exportPartners":["Germany 10.32%","Sweden 9.79%","Russia 9%","US 7.85%","Netherlands 5.9%","UK 5.24%","China 4.1%"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","petroleum and petroleum products","chemicals","transport equipment","iron and steel","machinery","textile yarn and fabrics","grains"],"importPartners":["Russia 16.28%","Germany 15.76%","Sweden 14.65%","Netherlands 6.99%","China 5.29%","France 4.22%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1430000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":7700000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern system with excellent service","domestic":"digital fiber-optic fixed-line network and an extensive mobile-cellular network provide domestic needs","international":"country code - 358;
