{"code":"mi","name":"Malawi","region":"Africa","background":"Established in 1891, the British protectorate of Nyasaland became the independent nation of Malawi in 1964. After three decades of one-party rule under President Hastings Kamuzu BANDA the country held multiparty elections in 1994, under a provisional constitution that came into full effect the following year. Current President Bingu wa MUTHARIKA, elected in May 2004 after a failed attempt by the previous president to amend the constitution to permit another term, struggled to assert his authority against his predecessor and subsequently started his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2005. As president, MUTHARIKA has overseen some economic improvement. Population growth, increasing pressure on agricultural lands, corruption, and the spread of HIV/AIDS pose major problems for Malawi. MUTHARIKA was reelected to a second term in May 2009.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Africa, east of Zambia, west and north of Mozambique","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":13,"min":30},"E":{"deg":34,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":118484,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":94080,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":24404,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Pennsylvania","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":2881,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Mozambique 1,569 km, Tanzania 475 km, Zambia 837 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"narrow elongated plateau with rolling plains, rounded hills, some mountains","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"junction of the Shire River and international boundary with Mozambique 37 m","highest point":"Sapitwa (Mount Mlanje) 3,002 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":20.68,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":1.18,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":78.14,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":590,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":17.3,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":1.01,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":78,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"NA","internationalEnvironmentAgreements":{"signed, but not ratified":"Law of the Sea","partyTo":["Biodiversity","Climate Change","Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol","Desertification","Endangered Species","Environmental Modification","Hazardous Wastes","Marine Life Conservation","Ozone Layer Protection","Ship Pollution","Wetlands"]},"naturalResources":["limestone","arable land","hydropower","unexploited deposits of uranium","coal","and bauxite"],"environmentalIssues":["deforestation","land degradation","water pollution from agricultural runoff, sewage, industrial wastes","siltation of spawning grounds endangers fish populations"],"climate":["sub-tropical","rainy season (November to May)","dry season (May to November)"],"geographyNote":["landlocked","Lake Nyasa, some 580 km long, is the country's most prominent physical feature"]},"people":{"Population":{"Population":15879,"country comparison to the world":""},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":45.1,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":52.2,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"2.7% (male 182,304/female 243,065) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":17.2,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":17.1,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":17.4,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":2.763,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":40.85,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":13.22,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":{"quantity":0,"unit":"migrant(s)/1,000 population"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":20,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":5.3,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Major cities - population":"Blantyre 856,000;

The economy is predominately agricultural with about 80% of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture, which has benefited from fertilizer subsidies since 2006, accounts for more than one-third of GDP and 90% of export revenues. The performance of the tobacco sector is key to short-term growth as tobacco accounts for more than half of exports. The economy depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and individual donor nations. In 2006, Malawi was approved for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program. In December 2007, the US granted Malawi eligibility status to receive financial support within the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) initiative. The government faces many challenges including developing a market economy, improving educational facilities, facing up to environmental problems, dealing with the rapidly growing problem of HIV/AIDS, and satisfying foreign donors that fiscal discipline is being tightened. Since 2005 President MUTHARIKA'S government has exhibited improved financial discipline under the guidance of Finance Minister Goodall GONDWE and signed a three year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility worth $56 million with the IMF. Improved relations with the IMF lead other international donors to resume aid as well. The government has announced infrastructure projects that could yield improvements, such as a new oil pipeline, for better fuel access, and the potential for a waterway link through Mozambican rivers to the ocean, for better transportation options. Since 2009, however, Malawi has experienced some setbacks, including a general shortage of foreign exchange, which has damaged its ability to pay for imports, and fuel shortages that hinder transportation and productivity. Investment fell 23% in 2009, and continued to decline in 2010. The government has failed to address barriers to investment such as unreliable power, water shortages, poor telecommunications infrastructure, and the high costs of services.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":12980000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5053000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":33.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":21.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":44.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5747000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":90,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":53,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":31.9,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":39,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":27.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1735000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1769000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":40.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":25.25,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":626500000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1434000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1720000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1771000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":17.3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1690000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":1572000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":8000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":6960,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-315 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1189000000},"Imports":{"usd":1675000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":301000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1213000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Malawian kwachas (MWK) per US dollar -","industries":["tobacco, tea, sugar, sawmill products, cement, consumer goods"],"agricultureProducts":["tobacco","sugarcane","cotton","tea","corn","potatoes","cassava (tapioca)","sorghum","pulses","groundnuts","Macadamia nuts","cattle","goats"],"exportCommodities":["tobacco 53%","tea","sugar","cotton","coffee","peanuts","wood products","apparel"],"exportPartners":["Germany 12.37%","Egypt 8.52%","South Africa 7.67%","Zimbabwe 7.55%","US 7.4%","Russia 6.79%","Netherlands 6.64%","Japan 4.1%"],"importCommodities":["food","petroleum products","semi-manufactures","consumer goods","transportation equipment"],"importPartners":["South Africa 40.15%","China 6.79%","India 6.73%","France 5.03%","Tanzania 4.81%","Mozambique 4.03%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":175000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2400000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"rudimentary;
