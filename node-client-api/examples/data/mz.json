{"code":"mz","name":"Mozambique","region":"Africa","background":"Almost five centuries as a Portuguese colony came to a close with independence in 1975. Large-scale emigration, economic dependence on South Africa, a severe drought, and a prolonged civil war hindered the country's development until the mid 1990s. The ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo) party formally abandoned Marxism in 1989, and a new constitution the following year provided for multiparty elections and a free market economy. A UN-negotiated peace agreement between Frelimo and rebel Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo) forces ended the fighting in 1992. In December 2004, Mozambique underwent a delicate transition as Joaquim CHISSANO stepped down after 18 years in office. His elected successor, Armando Emilio GUEBUZA, promised to continue the sound economic policies that have encouraged foreign investment. President GUEBUZA was reelected to a second term in October 2009. However, the elections were flawed by voter fraud, questionable disqualification of candidates, and Frelimo use of government resources during the campaign. As a result, Freedom House removed Mozambique from its list of electoral democracies.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Africa, bordering the Mozambique Channel, between South Africa and Tanzania","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":18,"min":15},"E":{"deg":35,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":799380,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":786380,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":13000,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than twice the size of California","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":4571,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Malawi 1,569 km, South Africa 491 km, Swaziland 105 km, Tanzania 756 km, Zambia 419 km, Zimbabwe 1,231 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2470,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"mostly coastal lowlands, uplands in center, high plateaus in northwest, mountains in west","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Indian Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Monte Binga 2,436 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":5.43,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.29,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":94.28,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":1180,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":216,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":0.63,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":32,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"severe droughts;

Socialist mismanagement and a brutal civil war from 1977-92 exacerbated the situation. In 1987, the government embarked on a series of macroeconomic reforms designed to stabilize the economy. These steps, combined with donor assistance and with political stability since the multi-party elections in 1994, have led to dramatic improvements in the country's growth rate. Fiscal reforms, including the introduction of a value-added tax and reform of the customs service, have improved the government's revenue collection abilities. In spite of these gains, Mozambique remains dependent upon foreign assistance for more than half of its annual budget, and the majority of the population remains below the poverty line. Subsistence agriculture continues to employ the vast majority of the country's work force and smallholder agricultural productivity and productivity growth is weak. A substantial trade imbalance persists although the opening of the Mozal aluminum smelter, the country's largest foreign investment project to date, has increased export earnings. At the end of 2007, and after years of negotiations, the government took over Portugal's majority share of the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectricity (HCB) company, a dam that was not transferred to Mozambique at independence because of the ensuing civil war and unpaid debts. More electrical power capacity is needed for additional investment projects in titanium extraction and processing and garment manufacturing that could further close the import/export gap. Mozambique's once substantial foreign debt has been reduced through forgiveness and rescheduling under the IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC initiatives, and is now at a manageable level. In July 2007 the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) signed a compact with Mozambique; the compact entered into force in September 2008 and will continue for five years. Compact projects will focus on improving sanitation, roads, agriculture, and the business regulation environment in an effort to spur economic growth in the four northern provinces of the country. Mozambique grew at an average annual rate of 9% in the decade up to 2007, one of Africa's strongest performances. However, heavy reliance on aluminum, which accounts for about one-third of exports, subjects the economy to volatile international prices. The sharp decline in aluminum prices during the global economic crisis lowered GDP growth by several percentage points. Despite 8.3% GDP growth in 2010, the increasing cost of living prompted citizens to riot in September 2010, after fuel, water, electricity, and bread price increases were announced. In an attempt to contain the cost of living, the government implemented subsidies, decreased taxes and tariffs, and instituted other fiscal measures.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":21810000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":9893000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":28.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":26,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":45.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":9870000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":81,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":21,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":70,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":39.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":47.3,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":17.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":2346000000},"expenditures":{"usd":2898000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":40.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":13.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":9.95,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":15.68,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":2657000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":3803000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2740000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":15910000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":10160000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":11820000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":8278000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":18000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":13760,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":3300000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":100000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":3200000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":127400000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.028 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":2517000000},"Imports":{"usd":3527000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1982000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":4990000000},"Exchange rates":"meticais (MZM) per US dollar -","industries":["food, beverages, chemicals (fertilizer, soap, paints), aluminum, petroleum products, textiles, cement, glass, asbestos, tobacco"],"agricultureProducts":["cotton","cashew nuts","sugarcane","tea","cassava (tapioca)","corn","coconuts","sisal","citrus and tropical fruits","potatoes","sunflowers","beef","poultry"],"exportCommodities":["aluminum","prawns","cashews","cotton","sugar","citrus","timber","bulk electricity"],"exportPartners":["Netherlands 47.62%","South Africa 11.6%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","vehicles","fuel","chemicals","metal products","foodstuffs","textiles"],"importPartners":["South Africa 33.54%","Netherlands 8.42%","India 5.93%","China 4.24%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":82400,"Telephones - mobile cellular":5971000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"a fair telecommunications system that is shackled with a heavy state presence, lack of competition, and high operating costs and charges","domestic":"stagnation in the fixed-line network contrasts with rapid growth in the mobile-cellular network;
