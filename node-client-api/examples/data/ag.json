{"code":"ag","name":"Algeria","region":"Africa","background":"After more than a century of rule by France, Algerians fought through much of the 1950s to achieve independence in 1962. Algeria's primary political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), was established in 1954 as part of the struggle for independence and has largely dominated politics since. The Government of Algeria in 1988 instituted a multi-party system in response to public unrest, but the surprising first round success of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991 balloting spurred the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the second round of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared would be an extremist-led government from assuming power. The army began a crackdown on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin attacking government targets, and fighting escalated into an insurgency, which saw intense violence between 1992-98 resulting in over 100,000 deaths - many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s, and FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in January 2000. Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA, with the backing of the military, won the presidency in 1999 in an election widely viewed as fraudulent. He was reelected to a second term in 2004, and overwhelmingly won a third term in 2009 after the government amended the constitution in 2008 to remove presidential term limits. Longstanding problems continue to face BOUTEFLIKA, including large-scale unemployment, a shortage of housing, unreliable electrical and water supplies, government inefficiencies and corruption, and the continuing activities of extremist militants. The Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) in 2006 merged with al-Qai'da to form al-Qai'da in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb, which has launched an ongoing series of kidnappings and bombings targeting the Algerian Government and Western interests. The Arab uprising across the Near Eastern and North African region beginning in December 2010, coupled with a sudden rise in the cost of food staples, triggered a wave of protests across Algeria during early 2011. Organizers of many of these protests included opposition political parties, labor and trade unions, and human rights organizations. The government's initial response to protester demands included lifting the 19-year state of emergency laws and temporarily cutting taxes and duties on selected food items, but demonstrators continued to attempt to organize protests. An overwhelming Algerian police response managed to contain most demonstrations with some reports of violence. In mid-April 2011, President BOUTEFLIKA said he would seek to amend the nation's constitution to reinforce representative democracy, propose changes to the election laws, and submit the proposals for national referendum.","geo":{"Location":"Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Morocco and Tunisia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":28,"min":0},"E":{"deg":3,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":2381,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":2381,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than 3.5 times the size of Texas","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":6343,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Libya 982 km, Mali 1,376 km, Mauritania 463 km, Morocco 1,559 km, Niger 956 km, Tunisia 965 km, Western Sahara 42 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":998,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive fishing zone":"32-52 nm"},"Terrain":"mostly high plateau and desert;

Gradual liberalization since the mid-1990s has opened up more of the economy, but in recent years Algeria has imposed new restrictions on foreign involvement in its economy and largely halted the privatization of state-owned industries. Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the eighth-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the fourth-largest gas exporter. It ranks 16th in oil reserves. Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $150 billion in foreign currency reserves and a large hydrocarbon stabilization fund. In addition, Algeria's external debt is extremely low at about 1% of GDP. Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside of hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy. The government's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high poverty and youth unemployment rates. In 2010, Algeria began a five-year, $286 billion development program to update the country's infrastructure and provide jobs. The costly program will boost Algeria's economy in 2011 but worsen the country's budget deficit. Long-term economic challenges include diversification from hydrocarbons, relaxing state control of the economy, and providing adequate jobs for younger Algerians.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":251100000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":160300000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":8.3,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":61.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":30.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":9877000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":13.4,"unit":"%"},"construction and public works":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"trade":{"quantity":14.6,"unit":"%"},"government":{"quantity":32,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":9.9,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":26.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":35.3,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":27.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":66480000000.00001},"expenditures":{"usd":85570000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":25.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":79070000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":109700000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":12290000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4.8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":34980000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":28340000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":273000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":279000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":2125000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":325000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1891000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":14320,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":13420000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":86500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":26830000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":59670000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":4502000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":3959000000},"Exports":{"usd":52660000000},"Imports":{"usd":37070000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":150100000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":4138000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":19340000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1844000000},"Exchange rates":"Algerian dinars (DZD) per US dollar -","industries":["petroleum, natural gas, light industries, mining, electrical, petrochemical, food processing"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","barley","oats","grapes","olives","citrus","fruits","sheep","cattle"],"exportCommodities":["petroleum","natural gas","and petroleum products 97%"],"exportPartners":["US 23.2%","Italy 17.23%","Spain 10.83%","France 7.97%","Canada 7.65%","Netherlands 5.19%","Turkey 4.22%"],"importCommodities":["capital goods","foodstuffs","consumer goods"],"importPartners":["France 19.7%","China 11.72%","Italy 10.19%","Spain 8.13%","Germany 5.77%","Turkey 5.05%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":2576000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":32729999.999999996,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"privatization of Algeria's telecommunications sector began in 2000;
