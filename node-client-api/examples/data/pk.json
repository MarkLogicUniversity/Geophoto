{"code":"pk","name":"Pakistan","region":"South Asia","background":"The Indus Valley civilization, one of the oldest in the world and dating back at least 5,000 years, spread over much of what is presently Pakistan. During the second millennium B.C., remnants of this culture fused with the migrating Indo-Aryan peoples. The area underwent successive invasions in subsequent centuries from the Persians, Greeks, Scythians, Arabs (who brought Islam), Afghans, and Turks. The Mughal Empire flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries; the British came to dominate the region in the 18th century. The separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim state of Pakistan (with West and East sections) and largely Hindu India was never satisfactorily resolved, and India and Pakistan fought two wars - in 1947-48 and 1965 - over the disputed Kashmir territory. A third war between these countries in 1971 - in which India capitalized on Islamabad's marginalization of Bengalis in Pakistani politics - resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. In response to Indian nuclear weapons testing, Pakistan conducted its own tests in 1998. India-Pakistan relations have been rocky since the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, but both countries are taking small steps to put relations back on track. In February 2008, Pakistan held parliamentary elections and in September 2008, after the resignation of former President MUSHARRAF, elected Asif Ali ZARDARI to the presidency. Pakistani government and military leaders are struggling to control domestic insurgents, many of whom are located in the tribal areas adjacent to the border with Afghanistan.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Asia, bordering the Arabian Sea, between India on the east and Iran and Afghanistan on the west and China in the north","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":30,"min":0},"E":{"deg":70,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":796095,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":770875,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":25220,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than twice the size of California","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":6774,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Afghanistan 2,430 km, China 523 km, India 2,912 km, Iran 909 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1046,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"flat Indus plain in east; mountains in north and northwest; Balochistan plateau in west","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Indian Ocean 0 m","highest point":"K2 (Mt.

Between 2001-07, however, poverty levels decreased by 10%, as Islamabad steadily raised development spending. During 2004-07, GDP growth in the 5-8% range was spurred by gains in the industrial and service sectors - despite severe electricity shortfalls - but growth slowed in 2008-09 and unemployment rose. Inflation remains the top concern among the public, climbing from 7.7% in 2007 to more than 13% in 2010. In addition, the Pakistani rupee has depreciated since 2007 as a result of political and economic instability. The government agreed to an International Monetary Fund Standby Arrangement in November 2008 in response to a balance of payments crisis, but during 2009-10 its current account strengthened and foreign exchange reserves stabilized - largely because of lower oil prices and record remittances from workers abroad. Record floods in July-August 2010 lowered agricultural output and contributed to a jump in inflation, and reconstruction costs will strain the limited resources of the government. Textiles account for most of Pakistan's export earnings, but Pakistan's failure to expand a viable export base for other manufactures has left the country vulnerable to shifts in world demand. Other long term challenges include expanding investment in education, healthcare, and electricity production, and reducing dependence on foreign donors.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":464900000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":174900000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":21.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":23.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":54.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":55770000,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":43,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":36.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":26.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":30.6,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":15,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":25330000000},"expenditures":{"usd":36240000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":49.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":13.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":12.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":59750000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":85220000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":71450000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":33240000000.000004},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4.9,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":90800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":72200000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":59140,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":373000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":30090,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":319500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":436200000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":37500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":37500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":840200000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-2.641 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":20290000000},"Imports":{"usd":32710000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":16100000000.000002},"Debt - external":{"usd":57210000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":30090000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1046999999.9999999},"Exchange rates":"Pakistani rupees (PKR) per US dollar -","industries":["textiles and apparel, food processing, pharmaceuticals, construction materials, paper products, fertilizer, shrimp"],"agricultureProducts":["cotton","wheat","rice","sugarcane","fruits","vegetables","milk","beef","mutton","eggs"],"exportCommodities":["textiles (garments","bed linen","cotton cloth","yarn)","rice","leather goods","sports goods","chemicals","manufactures","carpets and rugs"],"exportPartners":["US 15.87%","UAE 12.35%","Afghanistan 8.48%","UK 4.7%","China 4.44%"],"importCommodities":["petroleum","petroleum products","machinery","plastics","transportation equipment","edible oils","paper and paperboard","iron and steel","tea"],"importPartners":["China 15.35%","Saudi Arabia 10.54%","UAE 9.8%","US 4.81%","Kuwait 4.73%","Malaysia 4.43%","India 4.02%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":4058000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":103000000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"the telecommunications infrastructure is improving dramatically with foreign and domestic investments in fixed-line and mobile-cellular networks;
