{"code":"kn","name":"Korea, North","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"An independent kingdom for much of its long history, Korea was occupied by Japan beginning in 1905 following the Russo-Japanese War. Five years later, Japan formally annexed the entire peninsula. Following World War II, Korea was split with the northern half coming under Soviet-sponsored Communist control. After failing in the Korean War (1950-53) to conquer the US-backed Republic of Korea (ROK) in the southern portion by force, North Korea (DPRK), under its founder President KIM Il Sung, adopted a policy of ostensible diplomatic and economic \"self-reliance\" as a check against outside influence. The DPRK demonized the US as the ultimate threat to its social system through state-funded propaganda, and molded political, economic, and military policies around the core ideological objective of eventual unification of Korea under Pyongyang's control. KIM Il Sung's son, the current ruler KIM Jong Il, was officially designated as his father's successor in 1980, assuming a growing political and managerial role until the elder KIM's death in 1994. In 2010, KIM Jong Il began the process of preparing the way for his youngest son, KIM Jong Un, to succeed him in power. After decades of economic mismanagement and resource misallocation, the DPRK since the mid-1990s has relied heavily on international aid to feed its population. North Korea's history of regional military provocations, proliferation of military-related items, long-range missile development, WMD programs including tests of nuclear devices in 2006 and 2009, and massive conventional armed forces are of major concern to the international community. The regime has marked 2012, the centenary of KIM Il Sung's birth, a banner year; to that end, the country has been focused on development of the economy. \r\n","geo":{"Location":"Eastern Asia, northern half of the Korean Peninsula bordering the Korea Bay and the Sea of Japan, between China and South Korea","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":40,"min":0},"E":{"deg":127,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":120538,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":120408,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":130,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Mississippi","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1673,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"China 1,416 km, South Korea 238 km, Russia 19 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2495,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"mostly hills and mountains separated by deep, narrow valleys;

Industrial capital stock is nearly beyond repair as a result of years of underinvestment, shortages of spare parts, and poor maintenance. Large-scale military spending draws off resources needed for investment and civilian consumption. Industrial and power output have stagnated for years at a fraction of pre-1990 levels. Frequent weather-related crop failures aggravated chronic food shortages caused by on-going systemic problems, including a lack of arable land, collective farming practices, poor soil quality, insufficient fertilization, and persistent shortages of tractors and fuel. Large-scale international food aid deliveries have allowed the people of North Korea to escape widespread starvation since famine threatened in 1995, but the population continues to suffer from prolonged malnutrition and poor living conditions. Since 2002, the government has allowed private \"farmers' markets\" to begin selling a wider range of goods. It also permitted some private farming - on an experimental basis - in an effort to boost agricultural output. In October 2005, the government tried to reverse some of these policies by forbidding private sales of grains and reinstituting a centralized food rationing system. By December 2005, the government terminated most international humanitarian assistance operations in North Korea (calling instead for developmental assistance only) and restricted the activities of remaining international and non-governmental aid organizations. In mid-2008, North Korea began receiving food aid under a US program to deliver 500,000 metric tons of food via the World Food Program and US nongovernmental organizations; but Pyongyang stopped accepting the aid in March 2009. In December 2009, North Korea carried out a redenomination of its currency, capping the amount of North Korean won that could be exchanged for the new notes, and limiting the exchange to a one-week window. A concurrent crackdown on markets and foreign currency use yielded severe shortages and inflation, forcing Pyongyang to ease the restrictions by February 2010. In response to the sinking of the South Korean destroyer Cheonan and the shelling of Yeonpyong Island, South Korea's government cut off most aid, trade, and bilateral cooperation activities, with the exception of operations at the Kaesong Industrial Complex. The year 2012 will be the 100th anniversary of Kim Il-sung's birthday. The North Korean government often highlights its 2012 goal of becoming a \"strong and prosperous\" nation. Attracting foreign investment, especially from neighboring China, will be a key factor for improving the overall standard of living. Nevertheless, firm political control remains the government's overriding concern, which likely will inhibit changes to North Korea's current economic system.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":40000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":28000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-0.9% (2009 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":20.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":46.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":32.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":12200000,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":35,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":65,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":3200000000},"expenditures":{"usd":3300000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"NA%","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":22500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":18800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":118,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":16000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":13890,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":1997000000},"Imports":{"usd":3096000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":12500000000},"Exchange rates":"North Korean won (KPW) per US dollar (market rate)","industries":["military products","machine building, electric power, chemicals","mining (coal, iron ore, limestone, magnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead, and precious metals), metallurgy","textiles, food processing","tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["rice","corn","potatoes","soybeans","pulses","cattle","pigs","pork","eggs"],"exportCommodities":["minerals","metallurgical products","manufactures (including armaments)","textiles","agricultural and fishery products"],"exportPartners":["South Korea 47%","China 40%","Hong Kong 2% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["petroleum","coking coal","machinery and equipment","textiles","grain"],"importPartners":["China 61%","South Korea 24%","Singapore 2%","India 2% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1180000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"adequate system;
