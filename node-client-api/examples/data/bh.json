{"code":"bh","name":"Belize","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Belize was the site of several Mayan city states until their decline at the end of the first millennium A.D. The British and Spanish disputed the region in the 17th and 18th centuries; it formally became the colony of British Honduras in 1854. Territorial disputes between the UK and Guatemala delayed the independence of Belize until 1981. Guatemala refused to recognize the new nation until 1992 and the two countries are involved in an ongoing border dispute. Guatemala and Belize plan to hold a simultaneous referendum to determine if this dispute will go before the International Court of Justice at The Hague, though they have not yet set a date. Tourism has become the mainstay of the economy. Current concerns include the country's heavy foreign debt burden, high unemployment, growing involvement in the Mexican and South American drug trade, high crime rates, and one of the highest prevalence rates of HIV/AIDS in Central America.","geo":{"Location":"Central America, bordering the Caribbean Sea, between Guatemala and Mexico","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":17,"min":15},"W":{"deg":88,"min":45}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":22966,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":22806,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":160,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area -

The government's expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, initiated in September 1998, led to GDP growth averaging nearly 4% in 1999-2007. Oil discoveries in 2006 bolstered this growth. Exploration efforts have continued and production has increased a small amount. In February 2007, the government restructured nearly all of its public external commercial debt, which helped reduce interest payments and relieved some of the country's liquidity concerns. Growth slipped to 0% in 2009 and 1.5% in 2010 as a result of the global slowdown, natural disasters, and the drop in the price of oil. With weak economic growth and a large public debt burden, fiscal spending is likely to be tight. A key government objective remains the reduction of poverty and inequality with the help of international donors. Although Belize has the second highest per capita income in Central America, the average income figure masks a huge income disparity between rich and poor. The 2010 Poverty Assessment shows that more than 4 out of 10 people live in poverty. The sizable trade deficit and heavy foreign debt burden continue to be major concerns.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":2651000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1396000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":29,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":16.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":54.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":120500,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":10.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":18.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":71.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":13.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":43,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":26.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":370500000},"expenditures":{"usd":418000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":80,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":14.08,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":389500000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1351000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1291000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":213500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":198500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":248400000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":3990,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":7000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2260,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":7204,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":6700000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-151 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":404000000},"Imports":{"usd":740000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":219000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1010000000},"Exchange rates":"Belizean dollars (BZD) per US dollar -","industries":["garment production, food processing, tourism, construction, oil"],"agricultureProducts":["bananas","cacao","citrus","sugar","fish","cultured shrimp","lumber"],"exportCommodities":["sugar","bananas","citrus","clothing","fish products","molasses","wood","crude oil"],"exportPartners":["US 30.7%","UK 29.77%","Nigeria 4.9%","Cote d'Ivoire 4.45%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","manufactured goods","fuels","chemicals","pharmaceuticals","food","beverages","tobacco"],"importPartners":["US 33.65%","Mexico 14.17%","Cuba 8.51%","Guatemala 6.75%","Spain 6.07%","China 4.12%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":31200,"Telephones - mobile cellular":161800,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"above-average system;
