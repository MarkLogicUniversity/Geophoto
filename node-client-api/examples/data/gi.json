{"code":"gi","name":"Gibraltar","region":"Europe","background":"Strategically important, Gibraltar was reluctantly ceded to Great Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht; the British garrison was formally declared a colony in 1830. In a referendum held in 1967, Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a British dependency. The subsequent granting of autonomy in 1969 by the UK led to Spain closing the border and severing all communication links. A series of talks were held by the UK and Spain between 1997 and 2002 on establishing temporary joint sovereignty over Gibraltar. In response to these talks, the Gibraltar Government called a referendum in late 2002 in which the majority of citizens voted overwhelmingly against any sharing of sovereignty with Spain. Since late 2004, tripartite talks among Spain, the UK, and Gibraltar have been held with the aim of cooperatively resolving problems that affect the local population, and work continues on cooperation agreements in areas such as taxation and financial services; communications and maritime security; policy, legal and customs services; environmental protection; and education and visa services. Throughout 2009, a dispute over Gibraltar's claim to territorial waters extending out three miles gave rise to periodic non-violent maritime confrontations between Spanish and UK naval patrols. A new noncolonial constitution came into effect in 2007, and the European Court of First Instance recognized Gibraltar's right to regulate its own tax regime in December 2008, but the UK retains responsibility for defense, foreign relations, internal security, and financial stability.","geo":{"Location":"Southwestern Europe, bordering the Strait of Gibraltar, which links the Mediterranean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, on the southern coast of Spain","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":36,"min":8},"W":{"deg":5,"min":21}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"more than 10 times the size of The National Mall in Washington, D.C.","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Spain 1.2 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":12,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":3,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"a narrow coastal lowland borders the Rock of Gibraltar","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Mediterranean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Rock of Gibraltar 426 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":"NA","Natural hazards":"NA","naturalResources":["none"],"environmentalIssues":["limited natural freshwater resources: large concrete or natural rock water catchments collect rainwater (no longer used for drinking water) and adequate desalination plant"],"climate":["Mediterranean with mild winters and warm summers"],"geographyNote":["strategic location on Strait of Gibraltar that links the North Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea"]},"people":{"Population":28956,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":20.4,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":65.8,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"13.8% (male 1,934/female 2,062) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":33.3,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":32.4,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":34.3,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":0.273,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":14.23,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":8.18,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":"-3.32 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2011 est.)","Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":100,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":0.2,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":{"quantity":1.07,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years":{"quantity":1.06,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":1.02,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over":{"quantity":0.93,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population":{"quantity":1.01,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":{"quantity":6.69,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":7.44,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"female":{"quantity":5.87,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"}},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":{"quantity":78.68,"unit":"years"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":75.84,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":81.72,"unit":"years"}},"Total fertility rate":{"quantity":1.96,"unit":"children born/woman"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":"NA","HIV/AIDS - deaths":"NA","Nationality":{"noun":"Gibraltarian(s)","adjective":"Gibraltar"},"Literacy":{"definition":"NA","total population":"above 80%","male":"NA","female":"NA"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":"NA","Education expenditures":"NA","ethnicGroups":["Spanish","Italian","English","Maltese","Portuguese","German","North Africans"],"religions":["Roman Catholic 78.1%","Church of England 7%","other Christian 3.2%","Muslim 4%","Jewish 2.1%","Hindu 1.8%","other or unspecified 0.9%","none 2.9% (2001 census)"],"languages":["English (used in schools and for official purposes)","Spanish","Italian","Portuguese"]},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"none","conventional short form":"Gibraltar"},"Dependency status":"overseas territory of the UK","Government type":"NA","Capital":{"name":"Gibraltar","geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":36,"min":8},"W":{"deg":5,"min":21}},"time difference":"UTC+1 (6 hours ahead of Washington, DC during Standard Time)","daylight saving time":"+1hr, begins last Sunday in March;

Tax rates are low to attract foreign investment. The British military presence has been sharply reduced and now contributes about 7% to the local economy, compared with 60% in 1984. The financial sector, tourism (almost 5 million visitors in 1998), gaming revenues, shipping services fees, and duties on consumer goods also generate revenue. The financial sector, tourism, and the shipping sector contribute 30%, 30%, and 25%, respectively, of GDP. Telecommunications, e-commerce, and e-gaming account for the remaining 15%. In recent years, Gibraltar has seen major structural change from a public to a private sector economy, but changes in government spending still have a major impact on the level of employment.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1275000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1106000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":"12,690 (including non-Gibraltar laborers) (2001)","Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":"negligible","industry":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":60,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":475800000},"expenditures":{"usd":452300000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":146000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":146000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":21000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":25610,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":271000000},"Imports":{"usd":2967000000},"Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Gibraltar pounds (GIP) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, banking and finance, ship repairing, tobacco"],"agricultureProducts":["none"],"exportCommodities":["(principally reexports) petroleum 51%","manufactured goods"],"importCommodities":["fuels","manufactured goods","and foodstuffs"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":24000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":28600,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"adequate, automatic domestic system and adequate international facilities","domestic":"automatic exchange facilities","international":"country code - 350; radiotelephone; microwave radio relay; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean)"},"Broadcast media":"Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation (GBC) provides television and radio broadcasting services via 1 television station and 4 radio stations; British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) operates 1 radio station; broadcasts from Spanish radio and TV stations are accessible (2008)","Internet country code":".gi","Internet hosts":2053,"Internet users":20200},"transport":{"Airports":1,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":1,"1,524 to 2,437 m":1},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":29,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":29,"unit":"km"}},"Merchant marine":{"total":265,"country comparison to the world":"","by type":"bulk carrier 1, cargo 139, chemical tanker 65, container 35, liquefied gas 2, petroleum tanker 11, roll on/roll off 4, vehicle carrier 8","foreign-owned":250},"Ports and terminals":"Gibraltar"},"military":{"Military branches":"Royal Gibraltar Regiment (2009)","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":7037},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":6017,"females age 16-49":5706},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":228,"female":220},"Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of the UK; the Royal Gibraltar Regiment replaced the last British regular infantry forces in 1992"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["in 2002, Gibraltar residents voted overwhelmingly by referendum to reject any \"shared sovereignty\" arrangement","the government of Gibraltar insists on equal participation in talks between the UK and Spain","Spain disapproves of UK plans to grant Gibraltar even greater autonomy"]}}
