In 2005 the finance sector accounted for about 50% of the island's output. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export income earner. Milk products go to the UK and other EU countries. Tourism accounts for one-quarter of GDP. In recent years, the government has encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey with the result that an electronics industry has developed, displacing more traditional industries. All raw material and energy requirements are imported as well as a large share of Jersey's food needs. Light taxes and death duties make the island a popular tax haven. Living standards come close to those of the UK.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":5100000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5100000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"NA%","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":97,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":53560,"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":829000000},"expenditures":{"usd":851000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.7,"unit":"%"},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":630100000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":"NA kWh; note - electricity supplied by France","Exports":"$NA","Imports":"$NA","Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Jersey pounds per US dollar","industries":["tourism, banking and finance, dairy, electronics"],"agricultureProducts":["potatoes","cauliflower","tomatoes","beef","dairy products"],"exportCommodities":["light industrial and electrical goods","dairy cattle","foodstuffs","textiles","flowers"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","manufactured goods","foodstuffs","mineral fuels","chemicals"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":73900,"Telephones - mobile cellular":83900,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"state-owned, partially-competitive market; increasingly modern, with some broadband access","domestic":"digital telephone system launch announced in 2006 and currently being implemented; fixed-line and mobile-cellular services widely available; combined fixed and mobile-cellular density exceeds 100 per 100 persons","international":"country code - 44; submarine cable connectivity to Guernsey, the UK, and France (2008)"},"Broadcast media":"multiple UK terrestrial television broadcasts - received via a transmitter in Jersey with relays in Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney - will begin switching from analog to digital broadcasts in November 2010; satellite packages available; BBC Radio Jersey and 1 other radio station operating (2009)","Internet country code":".je","Internet hosts":237,"Internet users":29500},"transport":{"Airports":1,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":1,"1,524 to 2,437 m":1},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":576,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Merchant marine":{"registered in other countries":"11 (Gibraltar 1, India 1, Marshall Islands 9) (2010)","country comparison to the world":""},"Ports and terminals":"Gorey, Saint Aubin, Saint Helier"},"military":{"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":18688,"females age 16-49":18615},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":664,"female":590},"Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of the UK"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
