{"code":"iz","name":"Iraq","region":"Middle East","background":"Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq was occupied by Britain during the course of World War I; in 1920, it was declared a League of Nations mandate under UK administration. In stages over the next dozen years, Iraq attained its independence as a kingdom in 1932. A \"republic\" was proclaimed in 1958, but in actuality a series of strongmen ruled the country until 2003. The last was SADDAM Husayn. Territorial disputes with Iran led to an inconclusive and costly eight-year war (1980-88). In August 1990, Iraq seized Kuwait but was expelled by US-led, UN coalition forces during the Gulf War of January-February 1991. Following Kuwait's liberation, the UN Security Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles and to allow UN verification inspections. Continued Iraqi noncompliance with UNSC resolutions over a period of 12 years led to the US-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 and the ouster of the SADDAM Husayn regime. US forces remained in Iraq under a UNSC mandate through 2009 and under a bilateral security agreement thereafter, helping to provide security and to train and mentor Iraqi security forces. In October 2005, Iraqis approved a constitution in a national referendum and, pursuant to this document, elected a 275-member Council of Representatives (CoR) in December 2005. The CoR approved most cabinet ministers in May 2006, marking the transition to Iraq's first constitutional government in nearly a half century. In  January 2009, Iraq held elections for provincial councils in all provinces except for the three provinces comprising the Kurdistan Regional Government and Kirkuk province. Iraq held a national legislative election in March 2010, and after nine months of deadlock the CoR approved the new government in December 2010.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, bordering the Persian Gulf, between Iran and Kuwait","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":33,"min":0},"E":{"deg":44,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":438317,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":437367,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":950,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than twice the size of Idaho","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":3650,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Iran 1,458 km, Jordan 181 km, Kuwait 240 km, Saudi Arabia 814 km, Syria 605 km, Turkey 352 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":58,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"not specified"},"Terrain":"mostly broad plains;

Broader economic improvement, long-term fiscal health, and sustained increases in the standard of living still depend on the government passing major policy reforms and on continued development of Iraq's massive oil reserves. Although foreign investors viewed Iraq with increasing interest in 2010, most are still hampered by difficulties in acquiring land for projects and by other regulatory impediments. Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector, which provides over 90% of government revenue and 80% of foreign exchange earnings. Since mid-2009, oil export earnings have returned to levels seen before Operation Iraqi Freedom and government revenues have rebounded, along with global oil prices. In 2011 Baghdad probably will increase oil exports above the current level of 1.9 million barrels per day (bbl/day) as a result of new contracts with international oil companies, but is likely to fall short of the 2.4 million bbl/day it is forecasting in its budget. Iraq is making modest progress in building the institutions needed to implement economic policy. In 2010, Bagdad signed a new agreement with both the IMF and World Bank for conditional aid programs that will help strengthen Iraq's economic institutions. Some reform-minded leaders within the Iraqi government are seeking to pass laws to strengthen the economy. This legislation includes a package of laws to establish a modern legal framework for the oil sector and a mechanism to equitably divide oil revenues within the nation, although these and other important reforms are still under contentious and sporadic negotiation. Iraq's recent contracts with major oil companies have the potential to greatly expand oil revenues, but Iraq will need to upgrade its oil processing, pipeline, and export infrastructure to enable these deals to reach their potential. The Government of Iraq is pursuing a strategy to gain additional foreign investment in Iraq's economy. This includes an amendment to the National Investment Law, multiple international trade and investment events, as well as potential participation in joint ventures with state-owned enterprises. Provincial Councils also are using their own budgets to promote and facilitate investment at the local level. However, widespread corruption, inadequate infrastructure, insufficient essential services, and antiquated commercial laws and regulations stifle investment and continue to constrain the growth of private, non-energy sectors. The Central Bank has successfully held the exchange rate at approximately 1,170 Iraqi dinar/US dollar since January 2009. Inflation has decreased consistently since 2006 as the security situation has improved. However, Iraqi leaders remain hard pressed to translate macroeconomic gains into improved lives for ordinary Iraqis. Unemployment remains a problem throughout the country. Reducing corruption and implementing reforms - such as bank restructuring and developing the private sector - would be important steps in this direction.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":113400000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":82150000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":9.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":63,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":27.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":8500000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":21.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":18.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":59.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":15.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":52800000000},"expenditures":{"usd":72400000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":8.83,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":15.64,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":35690000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":46010000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":21940000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":2600000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4.8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":46390000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":52000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":5600000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":2399000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":687000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1910000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":116900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":115000000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":1880000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":9454000000,"unit":"cu m"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":3170000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":2715000000},"Exports":{"usd":49100000000},"Imports":{"usd":42560000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":45680000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":52580000000},"Exchange rates":"Iraqi dinars (IQD) per US dollar -","industries":["petroleum, chemicals, textiles, leather, construction materials, food processing, fertilizer, metal fabrication/processing"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","barley","rice","vegetables","dates","cotton","cattle","sheep","poultry"],"exportCommodities":["crude oil 84%","crude materials excluding fuels","food and live animals"],"exportPartners":["US 27.62%","India 14.45%","Italy 10.14%","South Korea 8.62%","Taiwan 5.61%","China 4.23%","Netherlands 4.13%","Japan 3.99%"],"importCommodities":["food","medicine","manufactures"],"importPartners":["Turkey 24.99%","Syria 17.36%","US 8.66%","China 6.79%","Jordan 4.17%","Italy 3.98%","Germany 3.97%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1108000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":19722000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"the 2003 liberation of Iraq severely disrupted telecommunications throughout Iraq including international connections;
