Economic activity is strongly linked to the US with which American Samoa conducts most of its commerce. Tuna fishing and tuna processing plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the primary export. The two tuna canneries account for 80% of employment. In late September 2009, an earthquake and the resulting tsunami devastated American Samoa and nearby Samoa, disrupting transportation and power generation, and resulting in about 200 deaths. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency is overseeing a relief program of nearly $25 million. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to American Samoa's economic well being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism is a promising developing sector.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":575300000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":462200000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":"NA%"},"Labor force":17630,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":34,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":33,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":33,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":29.8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":155400000},"expenditures":{"usd":183600000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":"NA%","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":185000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":172100000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":4000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4140,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":445600000},"Imports":{"usd":308800000},"Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"the US dollar is used","industries":["tuna canneries (largely supplied by foreign fishing vessels), handicrafts"],"agricultureProducts":["bananas","coconuts","vegetables","taro","breadfruit","yams","copra","pineapples","papayas","dairy products","livestock"],"exportCommodities":["canned tuna 93%"],"importCommodities":["raw materials for canneries 56%","food","petroleum products","machinery and parts"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":10400,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2200,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"NA","domestic":"good telex, telegraph, facsimile, and cellular telephone services; domestic satellite system with 1 Comsat earth station","international":"country code - 1-684; satellite earth station - 1 (Intelsat-Pacific Ocean)"},"Broadcast media":"3 television stations broadcasting; multi-channel pay-per-view television services are available; about a dozen radio stations, some of which are repeater stations (2009)","Internet country code":".as","Internet hosts":1676,"Internet users":"NA"},"transport":{"Airports":3,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":3,"over 3,047 m":1,"914 to 1,523 m":1,"under 914 m":1},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":241,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Ports and terminals":"Pago Pago"},"military":{"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":14562,"females age 16-49":14129},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":775,"female":762},"Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of the US"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["Tokelau included American Samoa's Swains Island (Olohega) in its 2006 draft independence constitution"]}}
