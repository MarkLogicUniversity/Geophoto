The dual-island nation's agricultural production is focused on the domestic market and constrained by a limited water supply and a labor shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on tourist arrivals from the US, Canada, and Europe and potential damages from natural disasters. After taking office in 2004, the SPENCER government adopted an ambitious fiscal reform program, and was successful in reducing its public debt-to-GDP ratio from 120% to about 90% in 2008. However, the global financial crisis that began in 2008, has led to a significant increase in the national debt, which topped 130% at the end of 2010. The Antiguan economy experienced solid growth from 2003 to 2007, reaching over 12% in 2006 driven by a construction boom in hotels and housing associated with the Cricket World Cup, but growth dropped off in 2008 with the end of the boom. In 2009, Antigua's economy was severely hit by the global economic crisis, suffering from the collapse of its largest financial institution and a steep decline in tourism. This decline continued in 2010 as the country struggled with a yawning budget deficit.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1425000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1105000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-4.1% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":74.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":30000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":82,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":11,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":229500000},"expenditures":{"usd":293400000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.07,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":233500000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1186000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1130000000},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":110000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":102300000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":5000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":219,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":4690,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-211 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":84300000},"Imports":{"usd":522799999.99999994},"Debt - external":{"usd":359800000},"Exchange rates":"East Caribbean dollars (XCD) per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, construction, light manufacturing (clothing, alcohol, household appliances)"],"agricultureProducts":["cotton","fruits","vegetables","bananas","coconuts","cucumbers","mangoes","sugarcane","livestock"],"exportCommodities":["petroleum products","bedding","handicrafts","electronic components","transport equipment","food and live animals"],"importCommodities":["food and live animals","machinery and transport equipment","manufactures","chemicals","oil"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":37400,"Telephones - mobile cellular":134900,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"good automatic telephone system","domestic":"fixed-line teledensity roughly 40 per 100 persons;
