{"code":"th","name":"Thailand","region":"East & Southeast Asia","background":"A unified Thai kingdom was established in the mid-14th century. Known as Siam until 1939, Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country never to have been taken over by a European power. A bloodless revolution in 1932 led to a constitutional monarchy. In alliance with Japan during World War II, Thailand became a US treaty ally in 1954 after sending troops to Korea and fighting alongside the US in Vietnam. A military coup in September 2006 ousted then Prime Minister THAKSIN Chinnawat. December 2007 elections saw the pro-THAKSIN People's Power Party (PPP) emerge at the head of a coalition government that took office in February 2008. The anti-THAKSIN People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD, aka yellow-shirts) in May 2008 began street demonstrations against the new government, eventually occupying the prime minister's office in August and Bangkok's two international airports in November. After an early December 2008 court ruling that dissolved the ruling PPP and two other coalition parties for election violations, the Democrat Party formed a new coalition government and ABHISIT Wetchachiwa became prime minister. In October 2008 THAKSIN fled abroad in advance of an abuse of power conviction and has agitated his followers from abroad since then. THAKSIN supporters under the banner of the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD, aka red-shirts) rioted in April 2009, shutting down an ASEAN meeting in Pattaya. Following a February 2010 court verdict confiscating half of THAKSIN's frozen assets, the UDD staged large protests between March and May 2010, and occupied several blocks of downtown Bangkok. Clashes between security forces and protesters, elements of which were armed, resulted in at least 92 deaths and an estimated $1.5 billion in arson-related property losses. These protests exposed major cleavages in the Thai body politic that continue to hamper the current government. The ABHISIT administration has announced a plan for a general election some time in 2011 ahead of its full term by the year-end. Since January 2004, thousands have been killed as separatists in Thailand's southern ethnic Malay-Muslim provinces increased the violence associated with their cause.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Asia, bordering the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand, southeast of Burma","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":15,"min":0},"E":{"deg":100,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":513120,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":510890,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":2230,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than twice the size of Wyoming","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":4863,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Burma 1,800 km, Cambodia 803 km, Laos 1,754 km, Malaysia 506 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":3219,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"central plain;

Thai exports - mostly machinery and electronic components, agricultural commodities, and jewelry - continue to drive the economy, accounting for more than half of GDP. The global financial crisis of 2008-09 severely cut Thailand's exports, with most sectors experiencing double-digit drops. In 2009, the economy contracted 2.2%. In 2010, Thailand's economy expanded 7.6%, its fastest pace since 1995, as exports rebounded from their depressed 2009 level. Antigovernment protests during March-May and the country's polarized political situation had - at most - a temporary impact on business and consumer confidence. Although tourism was hit hard during the protests, its quick recovery helped boost consumer confidence to new highs. Moreover, business and investor sentiment remained buoyant as Thailand's stock market grew almost 5% during the three-month period. The economy probably will continue to experience high grow well into 2011.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":586900000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":318900000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":10.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":45.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":44,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":38700000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":42.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":19.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":37.9,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":9.6,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":33.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":43,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":24.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":56330000000},"expenditures":{"usd":56870000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":42.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":6.1,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":38000000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":354500000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":336000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":138200000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":14.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":148200000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":134400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":846000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":2313000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":380000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":356000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":269100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1695000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":430000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":28760000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":37310000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":8550000000.000001,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":342000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":12290000000},"Exports":{"usd":191300000000},"Imports":{"usd":156900000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":176100000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":82500000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":117900000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":20300000000},"Exchange rates":"baht per US dollar -","industries":["tourism, textiles and garments, agricultural processing, beverages, tobacco, cement, light manufacturing such as jewelry and electric appliances, computers and parts, integrated circuits, furniture, plastics, automobiles and automotive parts","world's second-largest tungsten producer and third-largest tin producer"],"agricultureProducts":["rice","cassava (tapioca)","rubber","corn","sugarcane","coconuts","soybeans"],"exportCommodities":["textiles and footwear","fishery products","rice","rubber","jewelry","automobiles","computers and electrical appliances"],"exportPartners":["US 10.9%","China 10.6%","Japan 10.3%","Hong Kong 6.2%","Australia 5.6%","Malaysia 5% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["capital goods","intermediate goods and raw materials","consumer goods","fuels"],"importPartners":["Japan 18.7%","China 12.7%","Malaysia 6.4%","US 6.3%","UAE 5%","Singapore 4.3%","South Korea 4.1% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":7024000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":83057000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"high quality system, especially in urban areas like Bangkok","domestic":"fixed line system provided by both a government owned and commercial provider;
