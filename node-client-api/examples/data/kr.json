The Gilbert Islands were granted self-rule by the UK in 1971 and complete independence in 1979 under the new name of Kiribati. The US relinquished all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix and Line Island groups in a 1979 treaty of friendship with Kiribati.","geo":{"Location":"Oceania, group of 33 coral atolls in the Pacific Ocean, straddling the Equator, as well as the International Date Line;

Commercially viable phosphate deposits were exhausted at the time of independence from the UK in 1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Economic development is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak infrastructure, and remoteness from international markets. Tourism provides more than one-fifth of GDP. Private sector initiatives and a financial sector are in the early stages of development. Foreign financial aid from the EU, UK, US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, UN agencies, and Taiwan accounts for 20-25% of GDP. Remittances from seamen on merchant ships abroad account for more than $5 million each year. Kiribati receives around $15 million annually for the government budget from an Australian trust fund.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":618000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":147000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":8.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":66.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":"7,870 economically active, not including subsistence farmers (2001 est.)","Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":32,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":65.3,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":55520000},"expenditures":{"usd":59710000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":0.2,"unit":"%"},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":14000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":13020000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":260.8,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-21 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":17000000},"Imports":{"usd":62000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":10000000},"Exchange rates":"Australian dollars (AUD) per US dollar -","industries":["fishing, handicrafts"],"agricultureProducts":["copra","taro","breadfruit","sweet potatoes","vegetables","fish"],"exportCommodities":["copra 62%","coconuts","seaweed","fish"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","machinery and equipment","miscellaneous manufactured goods","fuel"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":4000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":1000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"generally good quality national and international service","domestic":"wire line service available on Tarawa and Kiritimati (Christmas Island); connections to outer islands by HF/VHF radiotelephone; wireless service available in Tarawa since 1999","international":"country code - 686; Kiribati is being linked to the Pacific Ocean Cooperative Telecommunications Network, which should improve telephone service; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean)"},"Broadcast media":"1 television broadcast station that provides about 1 hour of local programming Monday-Friday; multi-channel TV packages provide access to Australian and US stations; 1 government-operated radio station broadcasting on AM, FM, and shortwave (2009)","Internet country code":".ki","Internet hosts":31,"Internet users":7800},"transport":{"Airports":19,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":4,"1,524 to 2,437 m":4},"Airports - with unpaved runways":{"total":15,"914 to 1,523 m":11,"under 914 m":4},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":670,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Waterways":"5 km (small network of canals in Line Islands) (2007)","Merchant marine":{"total":71,"country comparison to the world":"","by type":"bulk carrier 6, cargo 32, chemical tanker 6, passenger/cargo 1, petroleum tanker 11, refrigerated cargo 15","foreign-owned":"51 (China 28, Hong Kong 1, Italy 1, Singapore 11, South Korea 2, Taiwan 5, Turkey 3) (2010)"},"Ports and terminals":"Betio (Tarawa Atoll), Canton Island, English Harbor"},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces (establishment prevented by the constitution); Police Force (2011)","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":25190},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":18364,"females age 16-49":20302},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":1132,"female":1120},"Military expenditures":"NA","Military - note":"Kiribati does not have military forces; defense assistance is provided by Australia and NZ"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
