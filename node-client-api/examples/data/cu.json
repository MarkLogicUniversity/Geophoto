{"code":"cu","name":"Cuba","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"The native Amerindian population of Cuba began to decline after the European discovery of the island by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1492 and following its development as a Spanish colony during the next several centuries. Large numbers of African slaves were imported to work the coffee and sugar plantations, and Havana became the launching point for the annual treasure fleets bound for Spain from Mexico and Peru. Spanish rule eventually provoked an independence movement and occasional rebellions that were harshly suppressed. US intervention during the Spanish-American War in 1898 assisted the Cubans in overthrowing Spanish rule. The Treaty of Paris established Cuban independence from the US in 1902 after which the island experienced a string of governments mostly dominated by the military and corrupt politicians. Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959; his iron rule held the subsequent regime together for nearly five decades. He stepped down as president in February 2008 in favor of his younger brother Raul CASTRO. Cuba's Communist revolution, with Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and Africa during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The country faced a severe economic downturn in 1990 following the withdrawal of former Soviet subsidies worth $4 billion to $6 billion annually. Cuba at times portrays the US embargo, in place since 1961, as the source if its difficulties. Illicit migration to the US - using homemade rafts, alien smugglers, air flights, or via the southwest border - is a continuing problem. The US Coast Guard intercepted 982 individuals attempting to cross the Straits of Florida in fiscal year 2009.","geo":{"Location":"Caribbean, island between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, 150 km south of Key West, Florida","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":21,"min":30},"W":{"deg":80,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":110860,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":109820,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":1040,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Pennsylvania","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":29,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay 29 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":3735,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"mostly flat to rolling plains, with rugged hills and mountains in the southeast","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caribbean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Pico Turquino 2,005 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":27.63,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":6.54,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":65.83,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":8700,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":38.1,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":8.2,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":728,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"the east coast is subject to hurricanes from August to November (in general, the country averages about one hurricane every other year);

President Raul CASTRO said such changes were needed to update the economic model to ensure the survival of socialism. The government has introduced limited reforms, some initially implemented in the 1990s, to increase enterprise efficiency and alleviate serious shortages of food, consumer goods, and services. The average Cuban's standard of living remains at a lower level than before the downturn of the 1990s, which was caused by the loss of Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. Since late 2000, Venezuela has been providing oil on preferential terms, and it currently supplies about 100,000 barrels per day of petroleum products. Cuba has been paying for the oil, in part, with the services of Cuban personnel in Venezuela including some 30,000 medical professionals.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":114100000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":57490000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":22.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":72.9,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":5164000,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":19.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":60.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":10.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":46510000000},"expenditures":{"usd":48890000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":34.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":0.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":11570000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":35920000000},"Stock of domestic credit":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":0.8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":16890000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":13930000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":48340,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":169000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":104800,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":178900000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":400000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":400000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":70790000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-87 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":3311000000},"Imports":{"usd":10250000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":4847000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":19750000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA (31 December 2009 est.)","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":4138000000},"Exchange rates":"Cuban pesos (CUP) per US dollar -","industries":["sugar, petroleum, tobacco, construction, nickel, steel, cement, agricultural machinery, pharmaceuticals"],"agricultureProducts":["sugar","tobacco","citrus","coffee","rice","potatoes","beans","livestock"],"exportCommodities":["sugar","nickel","tobacco","fish","medical products","citrus","coffee"],"exportPartners":["China 25.68%","Canada 20.31%","Spain 6.79%","Netherlands 4.53%"],"importCommodities":["petroleum","food","machinery and equipment","chemicals"],"importPartners":["Venezuela 30.51%","China 15.48%","Spain 8.3%","US 6.87%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1168000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":443000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"greater investment beginning in 1994 and the establishment of a new Ministry of Information Technology and Communications in 2000 has resulted in improvements in the system;
