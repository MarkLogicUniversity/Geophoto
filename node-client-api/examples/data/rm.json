The Marshall Islands received more than $1 billion in aid from the US from 1986-2002. Agricultural production, primarily subsistence, is concentrated on small farms; the most important commercial crops are coconuts and breadfruit. Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts, tuna processing, and copra. The tourist industry, now a small source of foreign exchange employing less than 10% of the labor force, remains the best hope for future added income. The islands have few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports. Under the terms of the Amended Compact of Free Association, the US will provide millions of dollars per year to the Marshall Islands (RMI) through 2023, at which time a Trust Fund made up of US and RMI contributions will begin perpetual annual payouts. Government downsizing, drought, a drop in construction, the decline in tourism, and less income from the renewal of fishing vessel licenses have held GDP growth to an average of 1% over the past decade.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":133500000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":161700000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-0.3% (2008 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":31.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":14.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":53.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":14680,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":21.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":57.7,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":36,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":123300000},"expenditures":{"usd":1213000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":12.9,"unit":"%"},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Exports":{"usd":19400000},"Imports":{"usd":79400000},"Debt - external":{"usd":87000000},"Exchange rates":"the US dollar is used","industries":["copra, tuna processing, tourism, craft items (from seashells, wood, and pearls)"],"agricultureProducts":["coconuts","tomatoes","melons","taro","breadfruit","fruits","pigs","chickens"],"exportCommodities":["copra cake","coconut oil","handicrafts","fish"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","machinery and equipment","fuels","beverages and tobacco"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":4400,"Telephones - mobile cellular":1000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"digital switching equipment; modern services include telex, cellular, Internet, international calling, caller ID, and leased data circuits","domestic":"Majuro Atoll and Ebeye and Kwajalein islands have regular, seven-digit, direct-dial telephones; other islands interconnected by high frequency radiotelephone (used mostly for government purposes) and mini-satellite telephones","international":"country code - 692; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean); US Government satellite communications system on Kwajalein (2005)"},"Broadcast media":"no television broadcast station; a cable network is available on Majuro with programming via videotape replay and satellite relays; 4 radio broadcast stations; American Armed Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) provides satellite radio and television service to Kwajalein Atoll (2009)","Internet country code":".mh","Internet hosts":3,"Internet users":2200},"transport":{"Airports":15,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":4,"1,524 to 2,437 m":3,"914 to 1,523 m":1},"Airports - with unpaved runways":{"total":11,"914 to 1,523 m":10,"under 914 m":1},"Roadways":{"total":"2,028 km (includes 75 km of expressways) (2007)","country comparison to the world":""},"Merchant marine":{"total":1381,"country comparison to the world":"","by type":"barge carrier 1, bulk carrier 415, cargo 63, chemical tanker 314, combination ore/oil 2, container 206, liquefied gas 83, passenger 7, passenger/cargo 1, petroleum tanker 259, refrigerated cargo 14, roll on/roll off 9, vehicle carrier 7","foreign-owned":"1,284 (Australia 1, Bermuda 34, Brazil 1, Canada 4, China 16, Croatia 12, Cyprus 38, Denmark 7, Egypt 1, Germany 247, Greece 358, Hong Kong 3, India 8, Iraq 2, Isle of Man 2, Israel 1, Italy 1, Japan 41, Jersey 9, Latvia 18, Malaysia 11, Mexico 4, Monaco 21, Netherlands 16, Norway 57, Pakistan 1, Qatar 24, Romania 2, Russia 6, Singapore 28, Slovenia 6, South Korea 25, Switzerland 12, Taiwan 2, Turkey 72, UAE 17, UK 7, Ukraine 1, US 168)"},"Ports and terminals":"Enitwetak Island, Kwajalein, Majuro"},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces; under the 1983 Compact of Free Association, the US has full authority and responsibility for security and defense of the Marshall Islands; Marshall Islands Police (2009)","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":16446},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":13568,"females age 16-49":13606},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":653,"female":631},"Military expenditures":"NA","Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of the US"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["claims US territory of Wake Island"]}}
