Denmark is a member of the European Union (EU); Danish legislation and regulations conform to EU standards on almost all issues. Danes enjoy among the highest standards of living in the world and the Danish economy is characterized by extensive government welfare measures and an equitable distribution of income. Denmark is a net exporter of food and energy and enjoys a comfortable balance of payments surplus, but depends on imports of raw materials for the manufacturing sector. Within the EU, Denmark is among the strongest supporters of trade liberalization. After a long consumption-driven upswing, Denmark's economy began slowing in 2007 with the end of a housing boom. Housing prices dropped markedly in 2008-09. The global financial crisis has exacerbated this cyclical slowdown through increased borrowing costs and lower export demand, consumer confidence, and investment. The global financial crises cut Danish GDP by 0.9% in 2008 and 5.2% in 2009. Historically low levels of unemployment rose sharply with the recession but remain below 5%, based on the national measure, about half the level of the EU; harmonized to OECD standards the unemployment rate was about 8% at the end of 2010. Denmark made a modest recovery in 2010 in part because of increased government spending. An impending decline in the ratio of workers to retirees will be a major long-term issue. Denmark maintained a healthy budget surplus for many years up to 2008, but the budget balance swung into deficit during 2009-10. Nonetheless, Denmark's fiscal position remains among the strongest in the EU. Despite previously meeting the criteria to join the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), so far Denmark has decided not to join, although the Danish krone remains pegged to the euro.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":201700000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":310800000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":22.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":76.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2820000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":77.3,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":12.1,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":28.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":29,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":17.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":160300000000},"expenditures":{"usd":175900000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":46.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":148100000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":209000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":636500000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":186900000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":36400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":34299999999.999996,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":11360000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":12820000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":262100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":166500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":268500,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":173100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1060000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":8398000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":4410000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":3980000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":61300000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":14350000000},"Exports":{"usd":99370000000},"Imports":{"usd":90830000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":559500000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":149600000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":199800000000},"Exchange rates":"Danish kroner (DKK) per US dollar -","industries":["iron, steel, nonferrous metals, chemicals, food processing, machinery and transportation equipment, textiles and clothing, electronics, construction, furniture and other wood products, shipbuilding and refurbishment, windmills, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment"],"agricultureProducts":["barley","wheat","potatoes","sugar beets","pork","dairy products","fish"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and instruments","meat and meat products","dairy products","fish","pharmaceuticals","furniture","windmills"],"exportPartners":["Germany 17.53%","Sweden 12.68%","UK 8.49%","US 6.05%","Norway 6.01%","Netherlands 4.84%","France 4.57%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","raw materials and semimanufactures for industry","chemicals","grain and foodstuffs","consumer goods"],"importPartners":["Germany 21.07%","Sweden 13.18%","Norway 7%","Netherlands 6.97%","China 6.22%","UK 5.53%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":2061999.9999999998,"Telephones - mobile cellular":7406000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"excellent telephone and telegraph services","domestic":"buried and submarine cables and microwave radio relay form trunk network, multiple cellular mobile communications systems","international":"country code - 45;
