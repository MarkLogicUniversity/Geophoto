{"code":"ve","name":"Venezuela","region":"South America","background":"Venezuela was one of three countries that emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Ecuador and New Granada, which became Colombia). For most of the first half of the 20th century, Venezuela was ruled by generally benevolent military strongmen, who promoted the oil industry and allowed for some social reforms. Democratically elected governments have held sway since 1959. Hugo CHAVEZ, president since 1999, seeks to implement his \"21st Century Socialism,\" which purports to alleviate social ills while at the same time attacking capitalist globalization and existing democratic institutions. Current concerns include: a weakening of democratic institutions, political polarization, a politicized military, drug-related violence along the Colombian border, overdependence on the petroleum industry with its price fluctuations, and irresponsible mining operations that are endangering the rain forest and indigenous peoples.","geo":{"Location":"Northern South America, bordering the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, between Colombia and Guyana","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":8,"min":0},"W":{"deg":66,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":912050,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":882050,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":30000,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than twice the size of California","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":4993,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Brazil 2,200 km, Colombia 2,050 km, Guyana 743 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2800,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":15,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"Andes Mountains and Maracaibo Lowlands in northwest;

A nationwide strike between December 2002 and February 2003 had far-reaching economic consequences - real GDP declined by around 9% in 2002 and 8% in 2003 - but economic output recovered strongly through 2008. Fueled by high oil prices, record government spending helped to boost GDP by about 10% in 2006, 8% in 2007, and nearly 5% in 2008, before a sharp drop in oil prices caused a contraction in 2009-10. This spending, combined with recent minimum wage hikes and improved access to domestic credit, created a consumption boom which came at the cost of higher inflation - roughly 32% in 2008, and slowing only slightly to 30% in 2010, despite the lengthy downturn. Imports also jumped significantly before the recession of 2009. President Hugo CHAVEZ's continued efforts to increase the government's control of the economy by nationalizing firms in the agribusiness, financial, construction, oil, and steel sectors have hurt the private investment environment, reduced productive capacity, and slowed non-petroleum exports. In the first half of 2010 Venezuela faced the prospect of lengthy nationwide blackouts when its main hydroelectric power plant - which provides more than 35% of the country's electricity - nearly shut down. In May, 2010, CHAVEZ closed the unofficial foreign exchange market - the \"parallel\" market - in an effort to stem inflation and slow the currency's depreciation. In June 2010, the government created the \"Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities\" (SITME) to replace the \"parallel\" market. In December 2010, CHAVEZ eliminated the dual exchange rate system and unified the exchange rate at 4.3 bolivars per dollar. In January 2011, CHAVEZ announced the second devaluation of the bolivar within twelve months. In December 2010, the National Assembly passed a package of five organic laws designed to complete the transformation of the Venezuelan economy in line with CHAVEZ's vision of 21st century socialism. These laws likely will be implemented in 2011. Venezuela began 2011 wrestling with macroeconomic imbalances resulting from the government's unorthodox economic policies, a housing crisis, and a continuing electricity crisis.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":345200000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":290700000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-1.9% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":34.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":61.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":13300000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":64,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":12.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":37.9,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":32.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":41,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":16.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":50120000000},"expenditures":{"usd":56530000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":25.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":29.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":29.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":19.89,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":69360000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":78110000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":54220000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Industrial production growth rate":"-8% (2010 est.)","Electricity - production":{"quantity":113300000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":83020000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":540000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":1651000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":2472000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":740000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2182000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":97770000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":23060000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":24860000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1800000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":4983000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":22070000000},"Exports":{"usd":64870000000.00001},"Imports":{"usd":31370000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":29490000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":55610000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":37710000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":20970000000},"Exchange rates":"bolivars (VEB) per US dollar -","industries":["petroleum, construction materials, food processing, textiles","iron ore mining, steel, aluminum","motor vehicle assembly"],"agricultureProducts":["corn","sorghum","sugarcane","rice","bananas","vegetables","coffee","beef","pork","milk","eggs","fish"],"exportCommodities":["petroleum","bauxite and aluminum","minerals","chemicals","agricultural products","basic manufactures"],"exportPartners":["US 27.3%","Columbia 11.4%","China 12.8%","Brazil 8.8% (2009 est.)"],"importCommodities":["agricultural products","raw materials","machinery and equipment","transport equipment","construction materials"],"importPartners":["US 20.6%","Columbia 17.8%","China 12.8%","Mexico 8.7%","Brazil 4.7% (2009 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":6867000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":28124000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern and expanding","domestic":"domestic satellite system with 3 earth stations;
