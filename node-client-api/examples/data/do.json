France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which made the island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after independence, Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and tyrannical administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia CHARLES, the first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who remained in office for 15 years. Some 3,000 Carib Indians still living on Dominica are the only pre-Columbian population remaining in the eastern Caribbean.","geo":{"Location":"Caribbean, island between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, about half way between Puerto Rico and Trinidad and Tobago","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":15,"min":25},"W":{"deg":61,"min":20}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":751,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":751,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than four times the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":148,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"rugged mountains of volcanic origin","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caribbean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Morne Diablotins 1,447 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":6.67,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":21.33,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":72,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":"NA","Total renewable water resources":"NA","Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":0.02,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":213,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"flash floods are a constant threat;

In order to diversify the island's production base, the government also is attempting to develop an offshore financial sector and has signed an agreement with the EU to develop geothermal energy resources. In 2003, the government began a comprehensive restructuring of the economy - including elimination of price controls, privatization of the state banana company, and tax increases - to address an economic and financial crisis and to meet IMF requirements. This restructuring paved the way for an economic recovery - real growth for 2006 reached a two-decade high - and helped to reduce the debt burden, which remains at about 85% of GDP. Hurricane Dean struck the island in August 2007 causing damages equivalent to 20% of GDP. In 2009, growth slowed as a result of the global recession; it picked up only slightly in 2010.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":758000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":376000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":17.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":32.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":49.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":25000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":32,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":28,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":343000000},"expenditures":{"usd":277000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":78,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.02,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":74840000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":398500000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":213600000},"Agriculture - products":{"Agriculture - products":"bananas, citrus, mangos, root crops, coconuts, cocoa"},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":85000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":79050000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":838.2,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-72 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":94000000},"Imports":{"usd":296000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":213000000},"Exchange rates":"East Caribbean dollars (XCD) per US dollar -","industries":["soap, coconut oil, tourism, copra, furniture, cement blocks, shoes"],"exportCommodities":["bananas","soap","bay oil","vegetables","grapefruit","oranges"],"exportPartners":["Japan 28.62%","UK 19.81%","Antigua and Barbuda 7.7%","Guyana 6.52%","Jamaica 5.4%","Trinidad and Tobago 4.2%"],"importCommodities":["manufactured goods","machinery and equipment","food","chemicals"],"importPartners":["Japan 31.29%","US 19.73%","Trinidad and Tobago 11.8%","China 11.58%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":17500,"Telephones - mobile cellular":106000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"fully automatic network","domestic":"Fixed-line connections continued to decline slowly with the two active operators providing about 25 fixed-line connections per 100 persons;
