More than 934,000 tourists, mainly from the US, visited the islands in 2008. In the mid-1980s, the government began offering offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the islands, and incorporation fees now generate substantial revenues. Roughly 400,000 companies were on the offshore registry by yearend 2000. The adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late 1994, which provides a blanket of confidentiality with regulated statutory gateways for investigation of criminal offenses, made the British Virgin Islands even more attractive to international business. Livestock raising is the most important agricultural activity; poor soils limit the islands' ability to meet domestic food requirements. Because of traditionally close links with the US Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands has used the US dollar as its currency since 1959.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":853400000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1095000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-0.6% (2008 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":10.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":88.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":12770,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":0.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":40,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":59.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":204700000},"expenditures":{"usd":180400000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":7.1,"unit":"%"},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":45000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":41850000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":1000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":691.4,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":134300000},"Exports":{"usd":25300000},"Imports":"$187 million (2002 est.)
