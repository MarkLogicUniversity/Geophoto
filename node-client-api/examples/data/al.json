{"code":"al","name":"Albania","region":"Europe","background":"Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, but was conquered by Italy in 1939. Communist partisans took over the country in 1944. Albania allied itself first with the USSR (until 1960), and then with China (to 1978). In the early 1990s, Albania ended 46 years of xenophobic Communist rule and established a multiparty democracy. The transition has proven challenging as successive governments have tried to deal with high unemployment, widespread corruption, a dilapidated physical infrastructure, powerful organized crime networks, and combative political opponents. Albania has made progress in its democratic development since first holding multiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies remain. International observers judged elections to be largely free and fair since the restoration of political stability following the collapse of pyramid schemes in 1997; however, there have been claims of electoral fraud in every one of Albania's post-communist elections. The 2009 general elections resulted in no single party gaining a majority of the 140 seats in Parliament, and the Movement for Socialist Integration (LSI) and the Democratic Party (DP) combined to form a coalition government, the first such in Albania's history. The Socialist Party (SP) has, in effect, boycotted Parliament since it convened in September 2009 and has called for investigations into alleged electoral fraud in the June 2009 elections. Albania joined NATO in April 2009 and is a potential candidate for EU accession. Although Albania's economy continues to grow, the country is still one of the poorest in Europe, hampered by a large informal economy and an inadequate energy and transportation infrastructure.\r\n","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea and Ionian Sea, between Greece in the south and Montenegro and Kosovo to the north","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":41,"min":0},"E":{"deg":20,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":28748,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":27398,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":1350,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Maryland","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":717,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Greece 282 km, Macedonia 151 km, Montenegro 172 km, Kosovo 112 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":362,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"mostly mountains and hills;

Macroeconomic growth averaged around 6% between 2004-08, but declined to about 3% in 2009-10. Inflation is low and stable. The government has taken measures to curb violent crime, and recently adopted a fiscal reform package aimed at reducing the large gray economy and attracting foreign investment. Remittances, a significant catalyst for economic growth have declined from 12-15% of GDP to 9% of GDP in 2009, mostly from Albanians residing in Greece and Italy; this helps offset the towering trade deficit. The agricultural sector, which accounts for almost half of employment but only about one-fifth of GDP, is limited primarily to small family operations and subsistence farming because of lack of modern equipment, unclear property rights, and the prevalence of small, inefficient plots of land. Energy shortages because of a reliance on hydropower, and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure contribute to Albania's poor business environment and lack of success in attracting new foreign investment needed to expand the country's export base. FDI is among the lowest in the region, but the government has embarked on an ambitious program to improve the business climate through fiscal and legislative reforms. The completion of a new thermal power plant near Vlore has helped diversify generation capacity, and plans to upgrade transmission lines between Albania and Montenegro and Kosovo would help relieve the energy shortages. Also, with help from EU funds, the government is taking steps to improve the poor national road and rail network, a long-standing barrier to sustained economic growth.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":23860000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":11770000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":18.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":23.5,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":57.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1060000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":47.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":29.2,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":13.5,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":12.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":25.9,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":27.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":3205000000},"expenditures":{"usd":3571000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":59.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":12.46,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":2566000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":9245000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":7701000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":5201000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":6593000000,"unit":"kWh"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":1884000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":5400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":36000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":748.9,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":24080,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":199100000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":30000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":30000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":849500000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-1.245 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1550000000},"Imports":{"usd":4590000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1992000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2810000000},"Exchange rates":"leke (ALL) per US dollar -","industries":["food processing, textiles and clothing","lumber, oil, cement, chemicals, mining, basic metals, hydropower"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","corn","potatoes","vegetables","fruits","sugar beets","grapes","meat","dairy products"],"exportCommodities":["textiles and footwear","asphalt","metals and metallic ores","crude oil","vegetables","fruits","tobacco"],"exportPartners":["Italy 50.8%","Kosovo 6.2%","Turkey 5.9%","Greece 5.4%","China 5.5% (2010 est.)"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","foodstuffs","textiles","chemicals"],"importPartners":["Italy 28%","Greece 13%","China 6.3%","Turkey 5.6%","Germany 5.6% (2010 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":363000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":4162000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"despite new investment in fixed lines teledensity remains low with roughly 10 fixed lines per 100 people;
