Since World War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban. The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (which includes Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and economic integration with the US, its principal trading partner. Canada enjoys a substantial trade surplus with the US, which absorbs about three-fourths of Canadian exports each year. Canada is the US's largest foreign supplier of energy, including oil, gas, uranium, and electric power. Given its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and modern capital plant, Canada enjoyed solid economic growth from 1993 through 2007. Buffeted by the global economic crisis, the economy dropped into a sharp recession in the final months of 2008, and Ottawa posted its first fiscal deficit in 2009 after 12 years of surplus. Canada's major banks, however, emerged from the financial crisis of 2008-09 among the strongest in the world, owing to the financial sector's tradition of conservative lending practices and strong capitalization. During 2010, Canada's economy grew only 3%, due to decreased global demand and a highly valued Canadian dollar.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1330000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1574000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":78,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":18590000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"manufacturing":{"quantity":13,"unit":"%"},"construction":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":76,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":9.4,"unit":"%"}},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":46,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":32.1,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":605700000000},"expenditures":{"usd":677700000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":34,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":560800000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1469000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2963000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1681000000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5.8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":620700000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":536100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":55730000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":23500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":3289000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2151000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":2001000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1192000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":175200000000,"unit":"bbl"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":161300000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":94620000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":94670000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":16590000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1754000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-40.21 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":406800000000},"Imports":{"usd":406400000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":1008999999999.9999},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":528700000000.00006},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":602500000000},"Exchange rates":"Canadian dollars (CAD) per US dollar -","industries":["transportation equipment, chemicals, processed and unprocessed minerals, food products, wood and paper products, fish products, petroleum and natural gas"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","barley","oilseed","tobacco","fruits","vegetables","dairy products","forest products","fish"],"exportCommodities":["motor vehicles and parts","industrial machinery","aircraft","telecommunications equipment","chemicals","plastics","fertilizers","wood pulp","timber","crude petroleum","natural gas","electricity","aluminum"],"exportPartners":["US 75.02%","UK 3.37%","China 3.09%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","motor vehicles and parts","crude oil","chemicals","electricity","durable consumer goods"],"importPartners":["US 51.1%","China 10.88%","Mexico 4.56%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":18251000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":23081000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"excellent service provided by modern technology","domestic":"domestic satellite system with about 300 earth stations","international":"country code - 1;
