Vikings reached the island in the 10th century from Iceland; Danish colonization began in the 18th century, and Greenland was made an integral part of Denmark in 1953. It joined the European Community (now the EU) with Denmark in 1973 but withdrew in 1985 over a dispute centered on stringent fishing quotas. Greenland was granted self-government in 1979 by the Danish parliament; the law went into effect the following year. Greenland voted in favor of increased self-rule in November 2008 and acquired greater responsibility for internal affairs in June 2009. Denmark, however, continues to exercise control of Greenland's foreign affairs, security, and financial policy in consultation with Greenland's Home Rule Government.","geo":{"Location":"Northern North America, island between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean, northeast of Canada","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":72,"min":0},"W":{"deg":40,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":2166,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":2166,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than three times the size of Texas","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":44087,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":3,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive fishing zone":"200 nm or agreed boundaries or median line","continental shelf":"200 nm or agreed boundaries or median line"},"Terrain":"flat to gradually sloping icecap covers all but a narrow, mountainous, barren, rocky coast","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Gunnbjorn Fjeld 3,700 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":"NA","Natural hazards":"continuous permafrost over northern two-thirds of the island","naturalResources":["coal","iron ore","lead","zinc","molybdenum","diamonds","gold","platinum","niobium","tantalite","uranium","fish","seals","whales","hydropower","possible oil and gas"],"environmentalIssues":["protection of the arctic environment","preservation of the Inuit traditional way of life, including whaling and seal hunting"],"climate":["arctic to subarctic","cool summers, cold winters"],"geographyNote":["dominates North Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe","sparse population confined to small settlements along coast","close to one-quarter of the population lives in the capital, Nuuk","world's second largest ice cap"]},"people":{"Population":57670,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":22.3,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":70.2,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"7.6% (male 2,269/female 2,097) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":33.6,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":35,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":32.1,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":0.05,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":14.6,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":8.12,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":"-5.98 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2011 est.)","Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":84,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":0.3,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Major cities - population":"NUUK (capital) 15,000 (2009)","Sex ratio":{"at birth":{"quantity":1.051,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years":{"quantity":1.03,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":1.15,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over":{"quantity":1.05,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population":{"quantity":1.12,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":{"quantity":10.05,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":11.47,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"female":{"quantity":8.55,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"}},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":{"quantity":70.96,"unit":"years"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":68.33,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":73.74,"unit":"years"}},"Total fertility rate":{"quantity":2.13,"unit":"children born/woman"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":100,"HIV/AIDS - deaths":"NA","Nationality":{"noun":"Greenlander(s)","adjective":"Greenlandic"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"},"male":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"},"female":{"quantity":100,"unit":"%"}},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":"NA","Education expenditures":"NA","ethnicGroups":["Inuit 89%","Danish and other 11% (2009)"],"religions":["Evangelical Lutheran","traditional Inuit spiritual beliefs"],"languages":["Greenlandic (East Inuit) (official)","Danish (official)","English"]},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"none","conventional short form":"Greenland","local long form":"none","local short form":"Kalaallit Nunaat"},"Dependency status":"part of the Kingdom of Denmark;

The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays the dominant role in Greenland's economy. Greenland's GDP contracted about 2% in 2009 as a result of the global economic slowdown. Budget surpluses turned to deficits beginning in 2007 and unemployment has risen. During the last decade the Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) pursued conservative fiscal and monetary policies, but public pressure has increased for better schools, health care and retirement systems. The Greenlandic economy has benefited from increasing catches and exports of shrimp, Greenland halibut and, more recently, crabs. Due to Greenland's continued dependence on exports of fish - which account for 82% of exports - the economy remains very sensitive to foreign developments. International consortia are increasingly active in exploring for hydrocarbon resources off Greenland's western coast, and international studies indicate the potential for oil and gas fields in northern and northeastern Greenland. In May 2007 a US aluminum producer concluded a memorandum of understanding with the Greenland Home Rule Government to build an aluminum smelter and a power generation facility, which takes advantage of Greenland's abundant hydropower potential. Within the area of mining, olivine sand continues to be produced and gold production has resumed in south Greenland. Tourism also offers another avenue of economic growth for Greenland, with increasing numbers of cruise lines now operating in Greenland's western and southern waters during the peak summer tourism season.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1989000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":2029999999.9999998},"GDP - real growth rate":"-2% (2009 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":31.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":63.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":28240,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4.9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":31.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":63.2,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":9.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1470000000},"expenditures":{"usd":1510000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":9.4,"unit":"%"},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":310300000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":285600000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":4000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1183,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":5172,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"usd":485000000},"Imports":{"usd":867000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":58000000},"Exchange rates":"Danish kroner (DKK) per US dollar -","industries":["fish processing (mainly shrimp and Greenland halibut)","gold, niobium, tantalite, uranium, iron and diamond mining","handicrafts, hides and skins, small shipyards"],"agricultureProducts":["forage crops","garden and greenhouse vegetables","sheep","reindeer","fish"],"exportCommodities":["fish and fish products 72%","metals 10% (2008)"],"exportPartners":["Denmark 61.13%","Japan 13.69%","China 6.15%","Sweden 5.21%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","manufactured goods","food","petroleum products"],"importPartners":["Denmark 74.93%","Sweden 11.73%","Norway 2.29%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":22000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":53500,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"adequate domestic and international service provided by satellite, cables and microwave radio relay; totally digital since 1995","domestic":"microwave radio relay and satellite","international":"country code - 299; satellite earth stations - 15 (12 Intelsat, 1 Eutelsat, 2 Americom GE-2 (all Atlantic Ocean)) (2000)"},"Broadcast media":"the Greenland Broadcasting Company provides public radio and television services throughout the island with a broadcast station and a series of repeaters; a few private local television and radio stations broadcast; Danish public radio rebroadcasts are available (2007)","Internet country code":".gl","Internet hosts":15668,"Internet users":36000},"transport":{"Airports":15,"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":10,"2,438 to 3,047 m":2,"1,524 to 2,437 m":1,"914 to 1,523 m":1,"under 914 m":6},"Airports - with unpaved runways":{"total":5,"1,524 to 2,437 m":1,"914 to 1,523 m":2,"under 914 m":2},"Roadways":{"note":"although there are short roads in towns, there are no roads between towns; inter-urban transport takes place either by sea or air (2005)"},"Merchant marine":{"total":1,"country comparison to the world":"","by type":"passenger 1 (2010)"},"Ports and terminals":"Sisimiut"},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces","Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":15280},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":10765,"females age 16-49":11399},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":488,"female":478},"Military - note":"defense is the responsibility of Denmark"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["managed dispute between Canada and Denmark over Hans Island in the Kennedy Channel between Canada's Ellesmere Island and Greenland","Denmark (Greenland) and Norway have made submissions to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental shelf (CLCS) and Russia is collecting additional data to augment its 2001 CLCS submission"]}}
