The country has no known mineral resources and few exports and is almost entirely dependent upon imported food and fuel. Subsistence farming and fishing are the primary economic activities. Fewer than 1,000 tourists, on average, visit Tuvalu annually. Job opportunities are scarce and public sector workers make up most of those employed. About 15% of the adult male population work as seamen on merchant ships abroad, and remittances are a vital source of income contributing around $2 million in 2007. Substantial income is received annually from the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) an international trust fund established in 1987 by Australia, NZ, and the UK and supported also by Japan and South Korea. Thanks to wise investments and conservative withdrawals, this fund grew from an initial $17 million to an estimated value of $77 million in 2006. The TTF contributed nearly $9 million towards the government budget in 2006 and is an important cushion for meeting shortfalls in the government's budget. The US Government is also a major revenue source for Tuvalu because of payments from a 1988 treaty on fisheries. In an effort to ensure financial stability and sustainability, the government is pursuing public sector reforms, including privatization of some government functions and personnel cuts. Tuvalu also derives royalties from the lease of its \".tv\" Internet domain name with revenue of more than $2 million in 2006. A minor source of government revenue comes from the sale of stamps and coins. With merchandise exports only a fraction of merchandise imports, continued reliance must be placed on fishing and telecommunications license fees, remittances from overseas workers, official transfers, and income from overseas investments. Growing income disparities and the vulnerability of the country to climatic change are among leading concerns for the nation.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":36000000},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":32000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":16.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":27.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":56.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3615,"Labor force - by occupation":{"note":"people make a living mainly through exploitation of the sea, reefs, and atolls and from wages sent home by those abroad (mostly workers in the phosphate industry and sailors)"},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":21540000},"expenditures":{"usd":23050000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.8,"unit":"%"},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Current account balance":"$-11.68 million (2003)","Exports":{"usd":1000000},"Imports":{"usd":12910000},"Debt - external":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Tuvaluan dollars or Australian dollars (AUD) per US dollar -","industries":["fishing, tourism, copra"],"agricultureProducts":["coconuts","fish"],"exportCommodities":["copra","fish"],"importCommodities":["food","animals","mineral fuels","machinery","manufactured goods"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1700,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"serves particular needs for internal communications","domestic":"radiotelephone communications between islands","international":"country code - 688; international calls can be made by satellite"},"Broadcast media":"no television broadcast stations; many households use satellite dishes to watch foreign TV stations; 1 government-owned radio station, Radio Tuvalu, includes relays of programming from international broadcasters (2009)","Internet country code":".tv","Internet hosts":109478,"Internet users":4200},"transport":{"Airports":1,"Airports - with unpaved runways":{"total":1,"1,524 to 2,437 m":1},"Roadways":{"total":{"quantity":8,"unit":"km"},"country comparison to the world":"","paved":{"quantity":8,"unit":"km"}},"Merchant marine":{"total":66,"country comparison to the world":"","by type":"bulk carrier 7, cargo 20, chemical tanker 16, container 3, passenger 2, passenger/cargo 1, petroleum tanker 15, refrigerated cargo 1, vehicle carrier 1","foreign-owned":"49 (Thailand 1, Vietnam 6, Turkey 1, Switzerland 1, South Korea 1, Singapore 25, Maldives 1, Malaysia 1, Kenya 1, Hong Kong 1, China 9, Ukraine 1) (2010)"},"Ports and terminals":"Funafuti"},"military":{"Military branches":"no regular military forces; Tuvalu Police Force (2009)","Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":2021,"females age 16-49":2026},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":119,"female":111},"Military expenditures":"NA"},"issues":{"internationalDisputes":["none"]}}
