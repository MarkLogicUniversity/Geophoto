{"code":"ly","name":"Libya","region":"Africa","background":"The Italians supplanted the Ottoman Turks in the area around Tripoli in 1911 and did not relinquish their hold until 1943 when defeated in World War II. Libya then passed to UN administration and achieved independence in 1951. Following a 1969 military coup, Col. Muammar Abu Minyar al-QADHAFI began to espouse his own political system, the Third Universal Theory. The system is a combination of socialism and Islam derived in part from tribal practices and is supposed to be implemented by the Libyan people themselves in a unique form of \"direct democracy.\" QADHAFI has always seen himself as a revolutionary and visionary leader. He used oil funds during the 1970s and 1980s to promote his ideology outside Libya, supporting subversives and terrorists abroad to hasten the end of Marxism and capitalism. In addition, beginning in 1973, he engaged in military operations in northern Chad's Aozou Strip - to gain access to minerals and to use as a base of influence in Chadian politics - but was forced to retreat in 1987. UN sanctions in 1992 isolated QADHAFI politically following the downing of Pan AM Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. During the 1990s, QADHAFI began to rebuild his relationships with Europe. UN sanctions were suspended in April 1999 and finally lifted in September 2003 after Libya accepted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing. In December 2003, Libya announced that it had agreed to reveal and end its programs to develop weapons of mass destruction and to renounce terrorism. QADHAFI subsequently made significant strides in normalizing relations with Western nations. He hosted various Western European leaders as well as many working-level and commercial delegations, and made his first trip to Western Europe in 15 years when he traveled to Brussels in April 2004. The US rescinded Libya's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism in June 2006. In August 2008, the US and Libya signed a bilateral comprehensive claims settlement agreement to compensate claimants in both countries who allege injury or death at the hands of the other country, including the Lockerbie bombing, the LaBelle disco bombing, and the UTA 772 bombing. In October 2008, the US Government received $1.5 billion pursuant to the agreement to distribute to US national claimants, and as a result effectively normalized its bilateral relationship with Libya. The two countries then exchanged ambassadors for the first time since 1973 in January 2009. Libya in May 2010 was elected to its first three-year seat on the UN Human Rights Council, prompting protests from international non-governmental organizations and human rights campaigners. Unrest that began in several Near Eastern and North African countries in late December 2010 spread to several Libyan cities in February 2011. In response to QADHAFI's harsh military crackdown on protesters, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1973, which demanded an immediate ceasefire and authorized the international community to establish a no-fly zone over Libya. \r\n\r\n","geo":{"Location":"Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Egypt and Tunisia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":25,"min":0},"E":{"deg":17,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":1759,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":1759,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Alaska","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":4348,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Algeria 982 km, Chad 1,055 km, Egypt 1,115 km, Niger 354 km, Sudan 383 km, Tunisia 459 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":1770,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive fishing zone":{"quantity":62,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"mostly barren, flat to undulating plains, plateaus, depressions","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Sabkhat Ghuzayyil -47 m","highest point":"Bikku Bitti 2,267 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":1.03,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.19,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":98.78,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":4700,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":0.6,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":4.27,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":730,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"hot, dry, dust-laden ghibli is a southern wind lasting one to four days in spring and fall;

The weakness in world hydrocarbon prices in 2009 reduced Libyan government tax income and constrained economic growth. Substantial revenues from the energy sector coupled with a small population give Libya one of the highest per capita GDPs in Africa, but little of this income flows down to the lower orders of society. Libyan officials in the past five years have made progress on economic reforms as part of a broader campaign to reintegrate the country into the international fold. This effort picked up steam after UN sanctions were lifted in September 2003 and as Libya announced in December 2003 that it would abandon programs to build weapons of mass destruction. The process of lifting US unilateral sanctions began in the spring of 2004; all sanctions were removed by June 2006, helping Libya attract greater foreign direct investment, especially in the energy sector. Libyan oil and gas licensing rounds continue to draw high international interest; the National Oil Corporation (NOC) set a goal of nearly doubling oil production to 3 million bbl/day by 2012. In November 2009, the NOC announced that that target may slip to as late as 2017. Libya faces a long road ahead in liberalizing the socialist-oriented economy, but initial steps - including applying for WTO membership, reducing some subsidies, and announcing plans for privatization - are laying the groundwork for a transition to a more market-based economy. The non-oil manufacturing and construction sectors, which account for more than 20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to include the production of petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit agricultural output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food. Libya's primary agricultural water source remains the Great Manmade River Project, but significant resources are being invested in desalinization research to meet growing water demands.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":90570000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":74230000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":63.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":33.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1729000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":59,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":"NA"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":13.2,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":42310000000},"expenditures":{"usd":38920000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":8.41,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":29850000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":35980000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":55030000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":23980000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":22170000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":104000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":77000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":1790000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":280000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":1542000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":575.3,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":47000000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":15900000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":5500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":10400000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":1539000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":15530000000},"Exports":{"usd":44890000000},"Imports":{"usd":24470000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":107300000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":6378000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":18640000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":15320000000},"Exchange rates":"Libyan dinars (LYD) per US dollar -","industries":["petroleum, petrochemicals, aluminum, iron and steel, food processing, textiles, handicrafts, cement"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","barley","olives","dates","citrus","vegetables","peanuts","soybeans","cattle"],"exportCommodities":["crude oil","refined petroleum products","natural gas","chemicals"],"exportPartners":["Italy 37.65%","Germany 10.11%","France 8.44%","Spain 7.94%","Switzerland 5.93%","US 5.27%"],"importCommodities":["machinery","semi-finished goods","food","transport equipment","consumer products"],"importPartners":["Italy 18.9%","China 10.54%","Turkey 9.92%","Germany 9.78%","France 5.63%","Tunisia 5.25%","South Korea 4.02%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1101000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":5004000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"telecommunications system is state-owned and service is poor, but investment is being made to upgrade;
