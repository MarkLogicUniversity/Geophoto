{"code":"sa","name":"Saudi Arabia","region":"Middle East","background":"Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and home to Islam's two holiest shrines in Mecca and Medina. The king's official title is the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The modern Saudi state was founded in 1932 by ABD AL-AZIZ bin Abd al-Rahman Al SAUD (Ibn Saud) after a 30-year campaign to unify most of the Arabian Peninsula. A male descendent of Ibn Saud, his son ABDALLAH bin Abd al-Aziz, rules the country today as required by the country's 1992 Basic Law. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia accepted the Kuwaiti royal family and 400,000 refugees while allowing Western and Arab troops to deploy on its soil for the liberation of Kuwait the following year. The continuing presence of foreign troops on Saudi soil after the liberation of Kuwait became a source of tension between the royal family and the public until all operational US troops left the country in 2003. Major terrorist attacks in May and November 2003 spurred a strong on-going campaign against domestic terrorism and extremism. King ABDALLAH has continued the cautious reform program begun when he was crown prince. To promote increased political participation, the government held elections nationwide from February through April 2005 for half the members of 179 municipal councils. In December 2005, King ABDALLAH completed the process by appointing the remaining members of the advisory municipal councils. The king instituted an Inter-Faith Dialogue initiative in 2008 to encourage religious tolerance on a global level; in February 2009, he reshuffled the cabinet, which led to more moderates holding ministerial and judicial positions, and appointed the first female to the cabinet. The country remains a leading producer of oil and natural gas and holds more than 20% of the world's proven oil reserves. The government continues to pursue economic reform and diversification, particularly since Saudi Arabia's accession to the WTO in December 2005, and promotes foreign investment in the kingdom. A burgeoning population, aquifer depletion, and an economy largely dependent on petroleum output and prices are all ongoing governmental concerns. The 2010-11 uprising across Middle Eastern and North African countries sparked modest incidents in Saudi cities, predominantly by Shia demonstrators calling for the release of detainees and the withdrawal from Bahrain of the Gulf Cooperation Council's Peninsula Shield Force. Other relatively minor, non-Shia demonstrations focused on labor, prisoner, and infrastructure complaints. Protests in general were met by a strong police presence, with some arrests, but not the bloodshed seen in protests elsewhere in the region. King ABDALLAH in February and March 2011 announced a series of benefits to Saudi citizens including funds to build affordable housing, salary increases for government workers, and unemployment benefits. The King also announced that Riyadh would begin preparations for a second round of municipal elections in September 2011.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, north of Yemen","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":25,"min":0},"E":{"deg":45,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":2149,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":2149,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly more than one-fifth the size of the US","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":4431,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Iraq 814 km, Jordan 744 km, Kuwait 222 km, Oman 676 km, Qatar 60 km, UAE 457 km, Yemen 1,458 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2640,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":18,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"not specified"},"Terrain":"mostly uninhabited, sandy desert","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Persian Gulf 0 m","highest point":"Jabal Sawda' 3,133 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":1.67,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.09,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":98.24,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":17310,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":17.32,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":705,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"frequent sand and dust storms","volcanism":"Despite Saudi Arabia's many volcanic formations, there has been little activity in the past few centuries;

It possesses about 20% of the world's proven petroleum reserves, ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 80% of budget revenues, 45% of GDP, and 90% of export earnings. Saudi Arabia is encouraging the growth of the private sector in order to diversify its economy and to employ more Saudi nationals. Diversification efforts are focusing on power generation, telecommunications, natural gas exploration, and petrochemical sectors. Almost 6 million foreign workers play an important role in the Saudi economy, particularly in the oil and service sectors, while Riyadh is struggling to reduce unemployment among its own nationals. Saudi officials are particularly focused on employing its large youth population, which generally lacks the education and technical skills the private sector needs. Riyadh has substantially boosted spending on job training and education, most recently with the opening of the King Abdallah University of Science and Technology - Saudi Arabia's first co-educational university. As part of its effort to attract foreign investment, Saudi Arabia acceded to the WTO in December 2005 after many years of negotiations. The government has begun establishing six \"economic cities\" in different regions of the country to promote foreign investment and plans to spend $373 billion between 2010 and 2014 on social development and infrastructure projects to advance Saudi Arabia's economic development.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":622000000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":443700000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":61.9,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":35.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":7337000,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":6.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":21.4,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":71.9,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":10.8,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":24.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":185100000000},"expenditures":{"usd":173100000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":16.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":166900000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":286900000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":11240000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":318800000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":179100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":165100000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":9764000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2430000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":8728000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":79250,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":264600000000.00003,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":77100000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":77100000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":7461000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":52030000000},"Exports":{"usd":235300000000},"Imports":{"usd":99170000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":456200000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":82920000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":204300000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":18000000000},"Exchange rates":"Saudi riyals (SAR) per US dollar -","industries":["crude oil production, petroleum refining, basic petrochemicals, ammonia, industrial gases, sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), cement, fertilizer, plastics, metals, commercial ship repair, commercial aircraft repair, construction"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","barley","tomatoes","melons","dates","citrus","mutton","chickens","eggs","milk"],"exportCommodities":["petroleum and petroleum products 90%"],"exportPartners":["Japan 15.33%","South Korea 12.71%","US 12.2%","China 10.38%","India 7.12%","Taiwan 4.54%","Singapore 4.25%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","foodstuffs","chemicals","motor vehicles","textiles"],"importPartners":["US 12.32%","China 12.06%","Germany 7.67%","Japan 6.15%","South Korea 5.32%","India 4.99%","UK 4.72%","France 4.05%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":4171000.0000000005,"Telephones - mobile cellular":44864000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern system including a combination of extensive microwave radio relays, coaxial cables, and fiber-optic cables","domestic":"mobile-cellular subscribership has been increasing rapidly","international":"country code - 966;
