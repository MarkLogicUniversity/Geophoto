In 1918, the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new multinational state, which was named Yugoslavia in 1929. After World War II, Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia, which though Communist, distanced itself from Moscow's rule. Dissatisfied with the exercise of power by the majority Serbs, the Slovenes succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short 10-day war. Historical ties to Western Europe, a strong economy, and a stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia's transformation to a modern state. Slovenia acceded to both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004; it joined the eurozone in 2007.","geo":{"Location":"south Central Europe, Julian Alps between Austria and Croatia","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":46,"min":7},"E":{"deg":14,"min":49}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":20273,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":20151,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":122,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than New Jersey","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1086,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Austria 330 km, Croatia 455 km, Hungary 102 km, Italy 199 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":46.6,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"a short coastal strip on the Adriatic, an alpine mountain region adjacent to Italy and Austria, mixed mountains and valleys with numerous rivers to the east","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Adriatic Sea 0 m","highest point":"Triglav 2,864 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":8.53,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":1.43,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":90.04,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":100,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":32.1,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":0.9,"per capita":{"quantity":457,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"flooding;

With the highest per capita GDP in Central Europe, Slovenia has excellent infrastructure, a well-educated work force, and a strategic location between the Balkans and Western Europe. Privatization has lagged since 2002, and the economy has one of highest levels of state control in the EU. Structural reforms to improve the business environment have allowed for somewhat greater foreign participation in Slovenia's economy and have helped to lower unemployment. In March 2004, Slovenia became the first transition country to graduate from borrower status to donor partner at the World Bank. In December 2007, Slovenia was invited to begin the accession process for joining the OECD. Despite its economic success, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Slovenia has lagged behind the region average, and taxes remain relatively high. Furthermore, the labor market is often seen as inflexible, and legacy industries are losing sales to more competitive firms in China, India, and elsewhere. In 2009, the world recession caused the economy to contract - through falling exports and industrial production - by more than 8%, and unemployment to rise above 9%. Although growth resumed in 2010, the unemployment rate continued to rise, topping 10%.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":56580000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":47850000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":31,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":66.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":930000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":35,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":62.8,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":10.6,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":12.3,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3.4,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":24.6,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":28.4,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":18.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":22560000000},"expenditures":{"usd":25530000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":35.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1.75,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.47,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":10470000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":24030000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":52670000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":11770000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":13000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":14700000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":7820000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":6218000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":5,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":60000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":57000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":1050000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":1050000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-598 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":24970000000},"Imports":{"usd":25960000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":"$NA (31 December 2010 est.)","Debt - external":{"usd":51570000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":15730000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":9001000000},"Exchange rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar -","industries":["ferrous metallurgy and aluminum products, lead and zinc smelting","electronics (including military electronics), trucks, automobiles, electric power equipment, wood products, textiles, chemicals, machine tools"],"agricultureProducts":["potatoes","hops","wheat","sugar beets","corn","grapes","cattle","sheep","poultry"],"exportCommodities":["manufactured goods","machinery and transport equipment","chemicals","food"],"exportPartners":["Germany 19.36%","Italy 11.31%","Croatia 7.75%","Austria 7.42%","France 7.35%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","manufactured goods","chemicals","fuels and lubricants","food"],"importPartners":["Germany 16.46%","Italy 15.89%","Austria 11.81%","France 4.98%","Croatia 4.32%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1034000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2100000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"well-developed telecommunications infrastructure","domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity roughly 150 telephones per 100 persons","international":"country code - 386"},"Broadcast media":"public television broadcaster, Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTV), operates a system of national and regional TV stations;
