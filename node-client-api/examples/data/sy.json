{"code":"sy","name":"Syria","region":"Middle East","background":"Following World War I, France acquired a mandate over the northern portion of the former Ottoman Empire province of Syria. The French administered the area as Syria until granting it independence in 1946. The new country lacked political stability, however, and experienced a series of military coups during its first decades. Syria united with Egypt in February 1958 to form the United Arab Republic. In September 1961, the two entities separated, and the Syrian Arab Republic was reestablished. In November 1970, Hafiz al-ASAD, a member of the Socialist Ba'th Party and the minority Alawite sect, seized power in a bloodless coup and brought political stability to the country. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Syria lost the Golan Heights to Israel. During the 1990s, Syria and Israel held occasional peace talks over its return. Following the death of President al-ASAD, his son, Bashar al-ASAD, was approved as president by popular referendum in July 2000. Syrian troops - stationed in Lebanon since 1976 in an ostensible peacekeeping role - were withdrawn in April 2005. During the July-August 2006 conflict between Israel and Hizballah, Syria placed its military forces on alert but did not intervene directly on behalf of its ally Hizballah. In May 2007 Bashar al-ASAD was elected to his second term as president. Influenced by major uprisings that began elsewhere in the region, antigovernment protests broke out in the southern province of Da'ra in March 2011 and spread to other Syrian cities. Protesters called for the repeal of the restrictive Emergency Law allowing arrests without charge, the legalization of political parties, and the removal of corrupt local officials. The government responded with a mix of force and concessions, including the repeal of the Emergency Law, but as of mid-April 2011 had not succeeded in quelling protests.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Lebanon and Turkey","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":35,"min":0},"E":{"deg":38,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":185180,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":183630,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":1550,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than North Dakota","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":2253,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Iraq 605 km, Israel 76 km, Jordan 375 km, Lebanon 375 km, Turkey 822 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":193,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"primarily semiarid and desert plateau;

Damascus has implemented modest economic reforms in the past few years, including cutting lending interest rates, opening private banks, consolidating all of the multiple exchange rates, raising prices on some subsidized items, most notably gasoline and cement, and establishing the Damascus Stock Exchange - which began operations in 2009. In addition, President ASAD signed legislative decrees to encourage corporate ownership reform, and to allow the Central Bank to issue Treasury bills and bonds for government debt. Nevertheless, the economy remains highly controlled by the government. Long-run economic constraints include declining oil production, high unemployment, rising budget deficits, and increasing pressure on water supplies caused by heavy use in agriculture, rapid population growth, industrial expansion, and water pollution.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":107400000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":59330000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":17.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":26.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":55.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5527000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":67,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.3,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":11.9,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":16.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":12530000000},"expenditures":{"usd":15300000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":29.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":5.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.04,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":21600000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":161000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":27140000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":36500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":27350000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":1400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":400400,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":252000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":155000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":58710,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":2500000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":6040000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":6180000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":140000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":240700000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":649000000},"Exports":{"usd":12840000000},"Imports":{"usd":13570000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":17960000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":7682000000},"Exchange rates":"Syrian pounds (SYP) per US dollar -","industries":["petroleum, textiles, food processing, beverages, tobacco, phosphate rock mining, cement, oil seeds crushing, car assembly"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","barley","cotton","lentils","chickpeas","olives","sugar beets","beef","mutton","eggs","poultry","milk"],"exportCommodities":["crude oil","minerals","petroleum products","fruits and vegetables","cotton fiber","textiles","clothing","meat and live animals","wheat"],"exportPartners":["Iraq 30.22%","Lebanon 12.21%","Germany 8.89%","Egypt 6.8%","Saudi Arabia 5.04%","Italy 4.55%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","electric power machinery","food and livestock","metal and metal products","chemicals and chemical products","plastics","yarn","paper"],"importPartners":["Saudi Arabia 10.1%","China 9.95%","Turkey 6.97%","Egypt 6.44%","UAE 4.97%","Italy 4.93%","Russia 4.92%","Germany 4.38%","Lebanon 4.12%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":3871000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":9697000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"fair system currently undergoing significant improvement and digital upgrades, including fiber-optic technology and expansion of the network to rural areas","domestic":"the number of fixed-line connections has increased markedly since 2000;
