{"code":"ez","name":"Czech Republic","region":"Europe","background":"At the close of World War I, the Czechs and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form Czechoslovakia. During the interwar years, having rejected a federal system, the new country's leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the demands of other ethnic minorities within the republic, most notably the Sudeten Germans and the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). On the eve of World War II, the Czech part of the country was forcibly annexed to the Third Reich, and the Slovaks declared independence as a fascist ally of Nazi Germany. After the war, a reunited but truncated Czechoslovakia (less Ruthenia) fell within the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize Communist Party rule and create \"socialism with a human face.\" Anti-Soviet demonstrations the following year ushered in a period of harsh repression known as \"normalization.\" With the collapse of Soviet-backed authority in 1989, Czechoslovakia regained its freedom through a peaceful \"Velvet Revolution.\" On 1 January 1993, the country underwent a \"velvet divorce\" into its two national components, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004.","geo":{"Location":"Central Europe, between Germany, Poland, Slovakia, and Austria","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":49,"min":45},"E":{"deg":15,"min":30}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":78867,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":77247,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":1620,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than South Carolina","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1989,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Austria 362 km, Germany 815 km, Poland 615 km, Slovakia 197 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"Bohemia in the west consists of rolling plains, hills, and plateaus surrounded by low mountains;

While the conservative, inward looking Czech financial system has remained relative healthy, the small, open, export-driven Czech economy remains very sensitive to changes in the economic performance of its main export markets, especially Germany. When Western Europe and Germany fell into recession in late 2008, demand for Czech goods plunged, leading to double digit drops in industrial production and exports. As a result, real GDP fell 4.1% in 2009, with most of the decline occurring during the first quarter. Real GDP, however, has slowly recovered with positive quarter-on-quarter growth starting in the second half of 2009 and continuing throughout 2010. The auto industry remains the largest single industry and, together with its suppliers, accounts for as much as 20% of Czech manufacturing. The Czech Republic produced more than a million cars for the first time in 2010, over 80% of which were exported. Foreign and domestic businesses alike voice concerns about corruption, especially in public procurement. Other long term challenges include dealing with a rapidly aging population, funding an unsustainable pension and health care system, and diversifying away from manufacturing and toward a more high-tech, services-based, knowledge economy.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":261300000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":192200000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":38.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":59.5,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":5370000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":38.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":58.3,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":"NA (2009)"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":26,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":22.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":77900000000},"expenditures":{"usd":87870000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":40,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":0.25,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":3.9,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":96820000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":138600000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":119500000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":73100000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":15.9,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":82250000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":53420000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":22230000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":8580000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":10970,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":207600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":29670,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":219900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":15000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":178000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":8164000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":1111000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":9683000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":3072000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-5.956 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":116500000000},"Imports":{"usd":109200000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":42340000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":86790000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":130400000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":14670000000},"Exchange rates":"koruny (CZK) per US dollar -","industries":["motor vehicles, metallurgy, machinery and equipment, glass, armaments"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","potatoes","sugar beets","hops","fruit","pigs","poultry"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","raw materials and fuel","chemicals"],"exportPartners":["Germany 31.7%","Slovakia 8.7%","Poland 6.2%","France 5.5%","UK 4.9%","Austria 4.7%","Italy 4.5% (2010 est.)"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","raw materials and fuels","chemicals"],"importPartners":["Germany 25.6%","China 11.9%","Poland 6.5%","Russia 5.4%","Slovakia 5.2% (2010 est.)"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":2092000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":14258000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"privatization and modernization of the Czech telecommunication system got a late start but is advancing steadily;
