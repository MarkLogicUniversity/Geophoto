Although crops such as bananas, mangos, and avocados continue to be grown for export, tourism provides Saint Lucia's main source of income and the industry is the island's biggest employer. Tourism is the main source of foreign exchange, although tourism sector revenues declined with the global economic downturn as US and European travel dropped in 2009. The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is trying to revitalize the banana industry, although recent hurricanes have caused exports to contract. Saint Lucia is vulnerable to a variety of external shocks including volatile tourism receipts, natural disasters, and dependence on foreign oil. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is about 77% and high debt servicing obligations constrain the KING administration's ability to respond to adverse external shocks. Economic fundamentals remain solid, even though unemployment needs to be reduced.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1798000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":985000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":0.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":80,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":79700,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":21.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":53.6,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":320900000},"expenditures":{"usd":393300000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.58,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":244300000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1094000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1378000000},"Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"quantity":325000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":302200000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":3000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":2747,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-199 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":288000000},"Imports":{"usd":791000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":257000000},"Exchange rates":"East Caribbean dollars (XCD) per US dollar -","industries":["clothing, assembly of electronic components, beverages, corrugated cardboard boxes, tourism","lime processing, coconut processing"],"agricultureProducts":["bananas","coconuts","vegetables","citrus","root crops","cocoa"],"exportCommodities":["bananas 41%","clothing","cocoa","vegetables","fruits","coconut oil"],"exportPartners":["Spain 29.41%","UK 15.28%","South Korea 10.54%","US 9.75%","India 9.52%"],"importCommodities":["food 23%","manufactured goods 21%","machinery and transportation equipment 19%","chemicals","fuels"],"importPartners":["Brazil 83.44%","US 4.67%","Trinidad and Tobago 4.56%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":41000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":176000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"an adequate system that is automatically switched","domestic":"fixed-line teledensity is 25 per 100 persons and mobile-cellular teledensity is roughly 110 per 100 persons","international":"country code - 1-758;
