{"code":"ng","name":"Niger","region":"Africa","background":"Niger became independent from France in 1960 and experienced single-party and military rule until 1991, when Gen. Ali SAIBOU was forced by public pressure to allow multiparty elections, which resulted in a democratic government in 1993. Political infighting brought the government to a standstill and in 1996 led to a coup by Col. Ibrahim BARE. In 1999, BARE was killed in a counter coup by military officers who restored democratic rule and held elections that brought Mamadou TANDJA to power in December of that year. TANDJA was reelected in 2004 and in 2009 spearheaded a constitutional amendment that would allow him to extend his term as president. In February 2010, a military coup deposed TANDJA, immediately suspended the constitution and dissolved the Cabinet, and promised that elections would be held following a transitional period of unspecified duration. Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world with minimal government services and insufficient funds to develop its resource base. The largely agrarian and subsistence-based economy is frequently disrupted by extended droughts common to the Sahel region of Africa. A predominately Tuareg ethnic group emerged in February 2007, the Nigerien Movement for Justice, and attacked several military targets in Niger's northern region throughout 2007 and 2008. Successful government offensives in 2009 limited the rebels' operational capabilities.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, southeast of Algeria","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":16,"min":0},"E":{"deg":8,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":1267000,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":1266,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":300,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than twice the size of Texas","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":5697,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Algeria 956 km, Benin 266 km, Burkina Faso 628 km, Chad 1,175 km, Libya 354 km, Mali 821 km, Nigeria 1,497 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"predominately desert plains and sand dunes;

Drought, desertification, and strong population growth have undercut the economy. Niger shares a common currency, the CFA franc, and a common central bank, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), with seven other members of the West African Monetary Union. In December 2000, Niger qualified for enhanced debt relief under the International Monetary Fund program for Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and concluded an agreement with the Fund on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). Debt relief provided under the enhanced HIPC initiative significantly reduces Niger's annual debt service obligations, freeing funds for expenditures on basic health care, primary education, HIV/AIDS prevention, rural infrastructure, and other programs geared at poverty reduction. In December 2005, Niger received 100% multilateral debt relief from the IMF, which translates into the forgiveness of approximately US $86 million in debts to the IMF, excluding the remaining assistance under HIPC. In 2010, the Niger economy was recovering from the effects of a 2009 drought that reduced grain and cowpea production and decimated livestock herds. The economy was also hurt when the international community cut off non-humanitarian aid in response to TANDJA's moves to extend his term as president. Nearly half of the government's budget is derived from foreign donor resources. Future growth may be sustained by exploitation of oil, gold, coal, and other mineral resources.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":11050000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":5577000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":39,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":17,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":44,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":4688000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":90,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":"NA%","Population below poverty line":{"quantity":63,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":35.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":50.5,"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":320000000},"expenditures":{"usd":320000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":0.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":782600000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1038000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":683600000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":150000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":589500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":450000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":6000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":5367,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-321 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":428000000},"Imports":{"usd":800000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2100000000},"Exchange rates":"Communaute Financiere Africaine francs (XOF) per US dollar -","industries":["uranium mining, cement, brick, soap, textiles, food processing, chemicals, slaughterhouses"],"agricultureProducts":["cowpeas","cotton","peanuts","millet","sorghum","cassava (tapioca)","rice","cattle","sheep","goats","camels","donkeys","horses","poultry"],"exportCommodities":["uranium ore","livestock","cowpeas","onions"],"exportPartners":["France 52.63%","Nigeria 22.43%","US 18.24%"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","machinery","vehicles and parts","petroleum","cereals"],"importPartners":["China 16.32%","France 15.95%","Netherlands 7.66%","Algeria 7.15%","French Polynesia 6.11%","Nigeria 5.48%","Cote d'Ivoire 4.15%","US 4.05%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":65000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":2599000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"inadequate;
