The economy has a small formal sector, focused mainly on the export of those natural resources, and an informal sector, employing the majority of the population. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for 85% of the people. Mineral deposits, including copper, gold, and oil, account for nearly two-thirds of export earnings. Natural gas reserves amount to an estimated 227 billion cubic meters. A consortium led by a major American oil company is constructing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production facility that could begin exporting in 2014. As the largest investment project in the country's history, it has the potential to double GDP in the near-term and triple Papua New Guinea's export revenue. An American-owned firm also opened PNG's first oil refinery in 2004 and is building a second LNG production facility. The government faces the challenge of ensuring transparency and accountability for revenues flowing from this and other large LNG projects. The government of Prime Minister SOMARE has expended much of its energy remaining in power. He was the first prime minister ever to serve a full five-year term. The government has brought stability to the national budget, largely through expenditure control; however, it relaxed spending constraints in 2006 and 2007 as elections approached. In recent years, the government has opened up markets in telecommunications and air transport, making both more affordable to the people. Numerous challenges still face the government, including providing physical security for foreign investors, regaining investor confidence, restoring integrity to state institutions, promoting economic efficiency by privatizing moribund state institutions, and balancing relations with Australia, its former colonial ruler. Other socio-cultural challenges could upend the economy including an HIV/AIDS epidemic, with the second highest infection rate in all of East Asia and the Pacific, and chronic law and order and land tenure issues. The global financial crisis had little impact because of continued foreign demand for PNG's commodities.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":14950000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":9668000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":32.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":35.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":32.1,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3809000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":85,"unit":"%"},"industry":"NA%","services":"NA% (2005 est.)"},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":1.8,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":37,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.7,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":40.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":50.9,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":17.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":2917000000},"expenditures":{"usd":2765000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":27.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6.8,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.92,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.09,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":2551000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":4726000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":2796000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2010)","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":2885000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":2683000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":35090,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":36000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":32490,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":14380,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":170000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":100000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":100000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":226500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-99 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":5976000000},"Imports":{"usd":3547000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":3017000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1548000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"kina (PGK) per US dollar -","industries":["copra crushing, palm oil processing, plywood production, wood chip production","mining of gold, silver, and copper","crude oil production, petroleum refining","construction, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["coffee","cocoa","copra","palm kernels","tea","sugar","rubber","sweet potatoes","fruit","vegetables","vanilla","shell fish","poultry","pork"],"exportCommodities":["oil","gold","copper ore","logs","palm oil","coffee","cocoa","crayfish","prawns"],"exportPartners":["Australia 30.05%","Japan 7.48%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","manufactured goods","food","fuels","chemicals"],"importPartners":["Australia 43.27%","China 13.29%","Singapore 9.59%","US 6.4%","Japan 4.62%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":60000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":900000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"services are minimal;
