{"code":"ma","name":"Madagascar","region":"Africa","background":"Formerly an independent kingdom, Madagascar became a French colony in 1896 but regained independence in 1960. During 1992-93, free presidential and National Assembly elections were held ending 17 years of single-party rule. In 1997, in the second presidential race, Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the 1970s and 1980s, was returned to the presidency. The 2001 presidential election was contested between the followers of Didier RATSIRAKA and Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing secession of half of the country. In April 2002, the High Constitutional Court announced RAVALOMANANA the winner. RAVALOMANANA achieved a second term following a landslide victory in the generally free and fair presidential elections of 2006. In early 2009, protests over increasing restrictions on opposition press and activities resulted in RAVALOMANANA stepping down and the presidency was conferred to the mayor of Antananarivo, Andry RAJOELINA. Following negotiations in July and August of 2009, a power-sharing agreement with a 15-month transitional period was established, but has not yet been implemented.","geo":{"Location":"Southern Africa, island in the Indian Ocean, east of Mozambique","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":20,"min":0},"E":{"deg":47,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":587041,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":581540,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":5501,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly less than twice the size of Arizona","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":4828,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or 100 nm from the 2,500-m isobath"},"Terrain":"narrow coastal plain, high plateau and mountains in center","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Indian Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Maromokotro 2,876 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":5.03,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":1.02,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":93.95,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":10860,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":337,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":14.96,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":804,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"periodic cyclones;

This strategy placed the country on a slow and steady growth path from an extremely low level. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is a mainstay of the economy, accounting for more than one-fourth of GDP and employing 80% of the population. Exports of apparel have boomed in recent years primarily due to duty-free access to the US. However, Madagascar's failure to comply with the requirements of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) led to the termination of the country's duty-free access in January 2010. Deforestation and erosion, aggravated by the use of firewood as the primary source of fuel, are serious concerns. Former President RAVALOMANANA worked aggressively to revive the economy following the 2002 political crisis, which triggered a 12% drop in GDP that year. The current political crisis which began in early 2009 has dealt additional blows to the economy. Tourism dropped more than 50% in 2009, compared with the previous year, and many investors are wary of entering the uncertain investment environment.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":19410000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":8345000000.000001},"GDP - real growth rate":"-2% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":26.5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":16.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":56.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":9504000,"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":50,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":41.5,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":47.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":34.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":896900000},"expenditures":{"usd":1547000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":8.1,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":45,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1233000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2012000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1020000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":1044999999.9999999,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":971400000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":21000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":364.9,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":16940,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-600 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":1412000000},"Imports":{"usd":1958000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1038000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2973000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Malagasy ariary (MGA) per US dollar -","industries":["meat processing, seafood, soap, breweries, tanneries, sugar, textiles, glassware, cement, automobile assembly plant, paper, petroleum, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["coffee","vanilla","sugarcane","cloves","cocoa","rice","cassava (tapioca)","beans","bananas","peanuts","livestock products"],"exportCommodities":["coffee","vanilla","shellfish","sugar","cotton cloth","chromite","petroleum products"],"exportPartners":["France 28.9%","US 20.49%","Germany 5.89%","China 4.36%"],"importCommodities":["capital goods","petroleum","consumer goods","food"],"importPartners":["China 12.99%","Thailand 11.93%","Bahrain 7.1%","France 6.89%","US 4.13%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":181200,"Telephones - mobile cellular":5997000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"system is above average for the region;
