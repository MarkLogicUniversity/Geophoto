{"code":"jo","name":"Jordan","region":"Middle East","background":"Following World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the UK received a mandate to govern much of the Middle East. Britain separated out a semi-autonomous region of Transjordan from Palestine in the early 1920s, and the area gained its independence in 1946; it adopted the name of Jordan in 1950. The country's long-time ruler was King HUSSEIN (1953-99). A pragmatic leader, he successfully navigated competing pressures from the major powers (US, USSR, and UK), various Arab states, Israel, and a large internal Palestinian population. Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel in the 1967 war and barely managed to defeat Palestinian rebels who attempted to overthrow the monarchy in 1970. King HUSSEIN in 1988 permanently relinquished Jordanian claims to the West Bank. In 1989, he reinstituted parliamentary elections and initiated a gradual political liberalization; political parties were legalized in 1992. In 1994, he signed a peace treaty with Israel. King ABDALLAH II, the son of King HUSSEIN, assumed the throne following his father's death in February 1999. Since then, he has consolidated his power and undertaken an aggressive economic reform program. Jordan acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2000, and began to participate in the European Free Trade Association in 2001. In 2003, Jordan staunchly supported the Coalition ouster of SADDAM in Iraq and, following the outbreak of insurgent violence in Iraq, absorbed thousands of displaced Iraqis. Municipal elections were held in July 2007 under a system in which 20% of seats in all municipal councils were reserved by quota for women. Parliamentary elections were held in November 2010 and saw independent pro-government candidates win the vast majority of seats. Beginning in January 2011 in the wake of unrest in Tunisia and Egypt, several thousand Jordanians staged weekly demonstrations and marches in Amman and other cities throughout Jordan to protest government corruption, rising prices, rampant poverty, and high unemployment. In response, King Abdallah replaced his prime minister and formed a National Dialogue Commission with a reform mandate. Some opposition groups also called for sweeping political and constitutional reforms, particularly on a controversial election law.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, northwest of Saudi Arabia, between Israel (to the west) and Iraq","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":31,"min":0},"E":{"deg":36,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":89342,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":88802,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":540,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Indiana","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1635,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Iraq 181 km, Israel 238 km, Saudi Arabia 744 km, Syria 375 km, West Bank 97 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":26,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":3,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"mostly desert plateau in east, highland area in west;

Other economic challenges for the government include chronic high rates of poverty, unemployment, inflation, and a large budget deficit. Since assuming the throne in 1999, King ABDALLAH has implemented significant economic reforms, such as opening the trade regime, privatizing state-owned companies, and eliminating most fuel subsidies, which in the past few years have spurred economic growth by attracting foreign investment and creating some jobs. The global economic slowdown, however, has depressed Jordan's GDP growth. Export-oriented sectors such as manufacturing, mining, and the transport of re-exports have been hit the hardest. The Government approved two supplementary budgets in 2010, but sweeping tax cuts planned for 2010 did not materialize because of Amman's need for additional revenue to cover excess spending. The budget deficit is likely to remain high, at 5-6% of GDP, and Amman likely will continue to depend heavily on foreign assistance to finance the deficit in 2011. Jordan's financial sector has been relatively isolated from the international financial crisis because of its limited exposure to overseas capital markets. Jordan is currently exploring nuclear power generation to forestall energy shortfalls.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":34530000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":27530000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":3.1,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":3.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":30.3,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":66.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1719000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":77.4,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":13.4,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":14.2,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":30.7,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":39.7,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":30.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":6269000000},"expenditures":{"usd":8701000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":61.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.75,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":9.25,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":9386000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":35530000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":26850000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":31860000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":12210000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":10400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":176000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":200000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":108000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":108200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":250000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":2970000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":2720000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":6031000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-975 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":7333000000},"Imports":{"usd":12970000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":12640000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":5522000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":22190000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Jordanian dinars (JOD) per US dollar -","industries":["clothing, fertilizers, potash, phosphate mining, pharmaceuticals, petroleum refining, cement, inorganic chemicals, light manufacturing, tourism"],"agricultureProducts":["citrus","tomatoes","cucumbers","olives","strawberries","stone fruits","sheep","poultry","dairy"],"exportCommodities":["clothing","fertilizers","potash","phosphates","vegetables","pharmaceuticals"],"exportPartners":["US 17.13%","Iraq 17%","India 13.59%","Saudi Arabia 10.56%","Syria 4.18%","UAE 4.09%"],"importCommodities":["crude oil","machinery","transport equipment","iron","cereals"],"importPartners":["Saudi Arabia 17.3%","China 10.95%","US 6.94%","Germany 6.29%","Egypt 6.1%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":501200,"Telephones - mobile cellular":6014000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"service has improved recently with increased use of digital switching equipment;
