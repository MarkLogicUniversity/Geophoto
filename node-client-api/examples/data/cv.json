{"code":"cv","name":"Cape Verde","region":"Africa","background":"The uninhabited islands were discovered and colonized by the Portuguese in the 15th century; Cape Verde subsequently became a trading center for African slaves and later an important coaling and resupply stop for whaling and transatlantic shipping. Following independence in 1975, and a tentative interest in unification with Guinea-Bissau, a one-party system was established and maintained until multi-party elections were held in 1990. Cape Verde continues to exhibit one of Africa's most stable democratic governments. Repeated droughts during the second half of the 20th century caused significant hardship and prompted heavy emigration. As a result, Cape Verde's expatriate population is greater than its domestic one. Most Cape Verdeans have both African and Portuguese antecedents.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, group of islands in the North Atlantic Ocean, west of Senegal","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":16,"min":0},"W":{"deg":24,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":4033,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":4033,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Rhode Island","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":965,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"Maritime claims":"measured from claimed archipelagic baselines","territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"steep, rugged, rocky, volcanic","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Mt.

The economy is service oriented with commerce, transport, tourism, and public services accounting for about three-fourths of GDP. Although about 40% of the population lives in rural areas, the share of food production in GDP is low. About 82% of food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit financed by foreign aid and remittances from its large pool of emigrants; remittances supplement GDP by more than 20%. Despite the lack of resources, sound economic management has produced steadily improving incomes. Continued economic reforms are aimed at developing the private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy. Future prospects depend heavily on the maintenance of aid flows, the encouragement of tourism, remittances, and the momentum of the government's development program. Cape Verde became a member of the WTO in July 2008.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1908000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1651000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.4,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":9,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":16.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":74.8,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":196100,"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":21,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":30,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.9,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":40.6,"unit":"%"}},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":36.9,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":520700000.00000006},"expenditures":{"usd":680800000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":7.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.98,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":585000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1314000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1179000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":250000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":232500000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":2000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1619,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-286 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":114000000},"Imports":{"usd":858000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":296000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":325000000},"Exchange rates":"Cape Verdean escudos (CVE) per US dollar -","industries":["food and beverages, fish processing, shoes and garments, salt mining, ship repair"],"agricultureProducts":["bananas","corn","beans","sweet potatoes","sugarcane","coffee","peanuts","fish"],"exportCommodities":["fuel","shoes","garments","fish","hides"],"exportPartners":["Spain 53.98%","Portugal 22.23%","Morocco 7.13%"],"importCommodities":["foodstuffs","industrial products","transport equipment","fuels"],"importPartners":["Portugal 44.86%","Netherlands 15.51%","Spain 6.1%","Italy 4.46%","Brazil 4.21%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":72200,"Telephones - mobile cellular":392000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"effective system, extensive modernization from 1996-2000 following partial privatization in 1995","domestic":"major service provider is Cabo Verde Telecom (CVT);
