In 1840, their chieftains entered into a compact with Britain, the Treaty of Waitangi, in which they ceded sovereignty to Queen Victoria while retaining territorial rights. In that same year, the British began the first organized colonial settlement. A series of land wars between 1843 and 1872 ended with the defeat of the native peoples. The British colony of New Zealand became an independent dominion in 1907 and supported the UK militarily in both world wars. New Zealand's full participation in a number of defense alliances lapsed by the 1980s. In recent years, the government has sought to address longstanding Maori grievances.","geo":{"Location":"Oceania, islands in the South Pacific Ocean, southeast of Australia","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":41,"min":0},"E":{"deg":174,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":267710,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":267710,"unit":"sq km"},"water":"NA"},"Area - comparative":"about the size of Colorado","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":15134,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"predominately mountainous with some large coastal plains","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Aoraki-Mount Cook 3,754 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":5.54,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":6.92,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":87.54,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":6190,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":397,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":2.11,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":524,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":{"Natural hazards":"earthquakes are common, though usually not severe;

This dynamic growth has boosted real incomes - but left behind some at the bottom of the ladder - and broadened and deepened the technological capabilities of the industrial sector. Per capita income rose for ten consecutive years until 2007 in purchasing power parity terms, but fell in 2008-09. Debt-driven consumer spending drove robust growth in the first half of the decade, helping fuel a large balance of payments deficit that posed a challenge for economic managers. Inflationary pressures caused the central bank to raise its key rate steadily from January 2004 until it was among the highest in the OECD in 2007-08; international capital inflows attracted to the high rates further strengthened the currency and housing market, however, aggravating the current account deficit. The economy fell into recession before the start of the global financial crisis and contracted for five consecutive quarters in 2008-09. In line with global peers, the central bank cut interest rates aggressively and the government developed fiscal stimulus measures. The economy posted a 1.7% decline in 2009, but pulled out of recession late in the year, and achieved 2.1% growth in 2010. Nevertheless, key trade sectors remain vulnerable to weak external demand. The government plans to raise productivity growth and develop infrastructure, while reining in government spending.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":117800000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":140400000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":71.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":2320000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":19,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":74,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"%NA","highest 10%":"%NA"},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":36.2,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.6,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":56240000000},"expenditures":{"usd":62180000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":25.5,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":10.39,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":24150000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":118100000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":206200000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":67060000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":42400000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":39240000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":61150,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":154100,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":54560,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":143900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":60000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":4305000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":4320000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":"NA","Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":33979999999.999996,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-4.504 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":33240000000.000004},"Imports":{"usd":30240000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":17850000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":64330000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":67180000000.00001},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA (31 December 2009)","Exchange rates":"New Zealand dollars (NZD) per US dollar -","industries":["food processing, wood and paper products, textiles, machinery, transportation equipment, banking and insurance, tourism, mining"],"agricultureProducts":["dairy products","lamb and mutton","wheat","barley","potatoes","pulses","fruits","vegetables","wool","beef","fish"],"exportCommodities":["dairy products","meat","wood and wood products","fish","machinery"],"exportPartners":["Australia 23.36%","US 9.64%","China 9.21%","Japan 7.1%","UK 4.21%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","vehicles and aircraft","petroleum","electronics","textiles","plastics"],"importPartners":["Australia 18.4%","China 15.09%","US 10.45%","Japan 7.24%","Germany 4.16%","Singapore 4.12%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":1870000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":4700000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"excellent domestic and international systems","domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular telephone subscribership exceeds 150 per 100 persons","international":"country code - 64;
