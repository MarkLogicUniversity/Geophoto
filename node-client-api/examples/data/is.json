{"code":"is","name":"Israel","region":"Middle East","background":"Following World War II, the British withdrew from their mandate of Palestine, and the UN partitioned the area into Arab and Jewish states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Subsequently, the Israelis defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending the deep tensions between the two sides. The territories Israel occupied since the 1967 war are not included in the Israel country profile, unless otherwise noted. On 25 April 1982, Israel withdrew from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. In keeping with the framework established at the Madrid Conference in October 1991, bilateral negotiations were conducted between Israel and Palestinian representatives and Syria to achieve a permanent settlement. Israel and Palestinian officials signed on 13 September 1993 a Declaration of Principles (also known as the \"Oslo Accords\") guiding an interim period of Palestinian self-rule. Outstanding territorial and other disputes with Jordan were resolved in the 26 October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace. In addition, on 25 May 2000, Israel withdrew unilaterally from southern Lebanon, which it had occupied since 1982. In April 2003, US President BUSH, working in conjunction with the EU, UN, and Russia - the \"Quartet\" - took the lead in laying out a roadmap to a final settlement of the conflict by 2005, based on reciprocal steps by the two parties leading to two states, Israel and a democratic Palestine. However, progress toward a permanent status agreement was undermined by Israeli-Palestinian violence between September 2003 and February 2005. In the summer of 2005, Israel unilaterally disengaged from the Gaza Strip, evacuating settlers and its military while retaining control over most points of entry into the Gaza Strip. The election of HAMAS to head the Palestinian Legislative Council froze relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA). Ehud OLMERT became prime minister in March 2006 and presided over a 34-day conflict with Hizballah in Lebanon in June-August 2006 and a 23-day conflict with HAMAS in the Gaza Strip during December 2008 and January 2009. OLMERT, who in June 2007 resumed talks with PA President Mahmoud ABBAS, resigned in September 2008. Prime Minister Binyamin NETANYAHU formed a coalition in March 2009 following a February 2009 general election. Direct talks launched in September 2010 collapsed following the expiration of Israel's 10-month partial settlement construction moratorium in the West Bank. Diplomatic initiatives to revive the negotiations through proximity talks began at the end of 2010.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Egypt and Lebanon","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":31,"min":30},"E":{"deg":34,"min":45}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":20770,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":20330,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":440,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than New Jersey","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1017,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Egypt 266 km, Gaza Strip 51 km, Jordan 238 km, Lebanon 79 km, Syria 76 km, West Bank 307 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":273,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"to depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"Negev desert in the south;

It depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Cut diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products (fruits and vegetables) are the leading exports. Israel usually posts sizable trade deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's external debt is owed to the US, its major source of economic and military aid. Israel's GDP, after contracting slightly in 2001 and 2002 due to the Palestinian conflict and troubles in the high-technology sector, grew about 5% per year from 2004-07. The global financial crisis of 2008-09 spurred a brief recession in Israel, but the country entered the crisis with solid fundamentals - following years of prudent fiscal policy and a series of liberalizing reforms - and a resilient banking sector, and the economy has shown signs of an early recovery. Following GDP growth of 4% in 2008, Israel's GDP slipped to 0.2% in 2009, but reached 3.4% in 2010, as exports rebounded. The global economic downturn affected Israel's economy primarily through reduced demand for Israel's exports in the United States and EU, Israel's top trading partners. Exports of goods and services account for about 40% of the country's GDP. The Israeli Government responded to the recession by implementing a modest fiscal stimulus package and an aggressive expansionary monetary policy - including cutting interest rates to record lows, purchasing government bonds, and intervening in the foreign currency market. The Bank of Israel began raising interest rates in the summer of 2009 when inflation rose above the upper end of the Bank's target and the economy began to show signs of recovery.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":219400000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":213100000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":32.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":65,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":3080000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":16,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":82,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":6.4,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":23.6,"unit":"%"}},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.5,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":24.3,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":39.2,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":16.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":60590000000},"expenditures":{"usd":68680000000.00001}},"Public debt":{"quantity":77.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":1,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":3.73,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":27580000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":208800000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":169900000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":182100000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5.7,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":54500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":46380000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":2081000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":3806,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":231000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":69580,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":318900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":1940000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":1190000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":1190000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":"NA","Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":30440000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":6269000000},"Exports":{"usd":54310000000},"Imports":{"usd":55600000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":66980000000.00001},"Debt - external":{"usd":89680000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":64819999999.99999},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":58420000000},"Exchange rates":"new Israeli shekels (ILS) per US dollar -","industries":["high-technology products (including aviation, communications, computer-aided design and manufactures, medical electronics, fiber optics), wood and paper products, potash and phosphates, food, beverages, and tobacco, caustic soda, cement, construction, metals products, chemical products, plastics, diamond cutting, textiles, footwear"],"agricultureProducts":["citrus","vegetables","cotton","beef","poultry","dairy products"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and equipment","software","cut diamonds","agricultural products","chemicals","textiles and apparel"],"exportPartners":["US 35.05%","Hong Kong 6.02%","Belgium 4.95%"],"importCommodities":["raw materials","military equipment","investment goods","rough diamonds","fuels","grain","consumer goods"],"importPartners":["US 12.35%","China 7.43%","Germany 7.1%","Switzerland 6.94%","Belgium 5.42%","Italy 4.49%","UK 4.03%","Netherlands 3.98%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":3250000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":9022000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"most highly developed system in the Middle East although not the largest","domestic":"good system of coaxial cable and microwave radio relay;
