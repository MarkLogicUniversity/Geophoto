{"code":"rn","name":"Saint Martin","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Although sighted by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1493 and claimed for Spain, it was the Dutch who occupied the island in 1631 and set about exploiting its salt deposits. The Spanish retook the island in 1633, but continued to be harassed by the Dutch. The Spanish finally relinquished Saint Martin to the French and Dutch, who divided it between themselves in 1648. Friction between the two sides caused the border to frequently fluctuate over the next two centuries, with the French eventually holding the greater portion of the island (about 57%). The cultivation of sugar cane introduced slavery to the island in the late 18th century; the practice was not abolished until 1848. The island became a free port in 1939; the tourism industry was dramatically expanded during the 1970s and 1980s. In 2003, the populace of Saint Martin voted to secede from Guadeloupe and in 2007, the northern portion of the island became a French overseas collectivity. In 2010, the Dutch portion of the island became an independent nation within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.","geo":{"Location":"Caribbean, located in the Leeward Islands (northern) group; French part of the island of Saint Martin in the Caribbean Sea; Saint Martin lies east of the US Virgin Islands","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":18,"min":5},"W":{"deg":63,"min":57}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":54.4,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":54.4,"unit":"sq km"},"water":"NEGL"},"Area - comparative":"more than one-third the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":15,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Sint Maarten 15 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":58.9,"unit":"km"},"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caribbean Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Pic du Paradis 424 m"},"Natural hazards":"subject to hurricanes from July to November","naturalResources":["salt"],"environmentalIssues":["freshwater supply is dependent on desalinization of sea water"],"climate":["temperature averages 80-85 degrees all year long","low humidity, gentle trade winds, brief, intense rain showers","July-November is the hurricane season"],"geographyNote":["the island of Saint Martin is the smallest landmass in the world shared by two independent states, the French territory of Saint Martin and the Dutch territory of Sint Maarten"]},"people":{"Population":30615,"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":26.9,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":67.1,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"6% (male 829/female 1,017) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":31,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":29.9,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":31.8,"unit":"years"}},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":{"quantity":1.04,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years":{"quantity":0.99,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":0.91,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over":{"quantity":0.82,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population":{"quantity":0.93,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":"NA","Education expenditures":"NA","ethnicGroups":["creole (mulatto)","black","Guadeloupe Mestizo (French-East Asia)","white","East Indian"],"religions":["Roman Catholic","Jehovah's Witnesses","Protestant","Hindu"],"languages":["French (official)","English","Dutch","French Patois","Spanish","Papiamento (dialect of Netherlands Antilles)"]},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"Overseas Collectivity of Saint Martin","conventional short form":"Saint Martin","local long form":"Collectivity d'outre mer de Saint-Martin","local short form":"Saint-Martin"},"Dependency status":"overseas collectivity of France","Capital":{"name":"Marigot","geographical coordinates":{"N":{"deg":18,"min":4},"W":{"deg":63,"min":5}},"time difference":"UTC-4 (1 hour ahead of Washington, DC during Standard Time)"},"Independence":"none (overseas collectivity of France)","National holiday":"Bastille Day, 14 July (1789); note - local holiday is Schoalcher Day (Slavery Abolition Day) 12 July (1848)","Legal system":"French civil law","Suffrage":"18 years of age, universal","Executive branch":{"chief of state":"President Nicolas SARKOZY (since 16 May 2007), represented by Prefect Dominique LACROIX (since 21 March 2007)","head of government":"President of the Territorial Council Frantz GUMBS (since 5 May 2009)","cabinet":"Executive Council; note - there is also an advisory economic, social, and cultural council","election":"French president elected by popular vote to a five-year term; prefect appointed by the French president on the advice of the French Ministry of Interior; president of the Territorial Council elected by the members of the Council for a five-year term","election results":"Frantz GUMBS elected president by the Territorial Council on 7 August 2008 but election was declared invalid on 10 April 2009"},"Legislative branch":{"Legislative branch":"unicameral Territorial Council (23 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms)","elections":"last held on 1 and 8 July 2007 (next to be held in July 2012)","election results":"percent of seats by party - UPP 49%, RRR 42.2%, Reussir Saint-Martin 8.9%; seats by party - UPP 16, RRR 6, Reussir Saint-Martin 1"},"Political parties and leaders":"Union Pour le Progres or UPP [Louis-Constant FLEMING]; Rassemblement Responsabilite Reussite or RRR [Alain RICHARDSON]; Reussir Saint-Martin [Jean-Luc HAMLET]","Political pressure groups and leaders":"NA","Diplomatic representation in the US":"none (overseas collectivity of France)","Diplomatic representation from the US":"none (overseas collectivity of France)","Flag description":"the flag of France is used","National anthem":{"name":"\"O Sweet Saint Martin's Land\"","lyrics/music":"Gerard KEMPS"},"internationalOrganizations":["UPU"]},"economy":{"Economy - overview":"The economy of Saint Martin centers around tourism with 85% of the labor force engaged in this sector.
