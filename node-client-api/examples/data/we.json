{"code":"we","name":"West Bank","region":"Middle East","background":"The September 1993 Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements provided for a transitional period of Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Under a series of agreements signed between May 1994 and September 1999, Israel transferred to the Palestinian Authority (PA) security and civilian responsibility for many Palestinian-populated areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Negotiations to determine the permanent status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip stalled following the outbreak of an intifada in September 2000. In April 2003, the Quartet (US, EU, UN, and Russia) presented a roadmap to a final settlement of the conflict by 2005 based on reciprocal steps by the two parties leading to two states, Israel and a democratic Palestine. Following Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT's death in late 2004, Mahmud ABBAS was elected PA president in January 2005. A month later, Israel and the PA agreed to the Sharm el-Sheikh Commitments in an effort to move the peace process forward. In September 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew all its settlers and soldiers and dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip and withdrew settlers and redeployed soldiers from four small northern West Bank settlements. Nonetheless, Israel still controls maritime, airspace, and most access to the Gaza Strip. In January 2006, the Islamic Resistance Movement, HAMAS, won control of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC). HAMAS took control of the PA government in March 2006, but President ABBAS had little success negotiating with HAMAS to present a political platform acceptable to the international community so as to lift economic sanctions on Palestinians. Violent clashes between Fatah and HAMAS supporters in the Gaza Strip in 2006 and early 2007 resulted in numerous Palestinian deaths and injuries. In February 2007, ABBAS and HAMAS Political Bureau Chief MISHAL signed the Mecca Agreement in Saudi Arabia that resulted in the formation of a Palestinian National Unity Government (NUG) headed by HAMAS member Ismail HANIYA. However, fighting continued in the Gaza Strip, and in June 2007, HAMAS militants succeeded in a violent takeover of all military and governmental institutions in the Gaza Strip. ABBAS dismissed the NUG and through a series of presidential decrees formed a PA government in the West Bank led by independent Salam FAYYAD. HAMAS rejected the NUG's dismissal, and despite multiple rounds of Egyptian-brokered reconciliation negotiations, the two groups have failed to bridge their differences. The status quo remains with HAMAS in control of the Gaza Strip and ABBAS and the Fatah-dominated PA governing the West Bank. FAYYAD and his PA government continue to implement a series of security and economic reforms to improve conditions in the West Bank. ABBAS has said he will not resume negotiations with current Prime Minister NETANYAHU until Israel halts all settlement activity in the West Bank and Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\n","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, west of Jordan, east of Israel","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":32,"min":0},"E":{"deg":35,"min":15}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":5860,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":5640,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":220,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Delaware","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":404,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Israel 307 km, Jordan 97 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"mostly rugged dissected upland, some vegetation in west, but barren in east","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Dead Sea -408 m","highest point":"Tall Asur 1,022 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":16.9,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":18.97,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":64.13,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":"180 sq km; note - includes Gaza Strip (2003)","Natural hazards":"droughts","naturalResources":["arable land"],"environmentalIssues":["adequacy of freshwater supply","sewage treatment"],"climate":["temperate","temperature and precipitation vary with altitude, warm to hot summers, cool to mild winters"],"geographyNote":["landlocked","highlands are main recharge area for Israel's coastal aquifers","there are about 355 Israeli civilian sites including about 145 small outpost communities in the West Bank and 32 sites in East Jerusalem (2010 est.)"]},"people":{"Population":{"Population":2568,"country comparison to the world":""},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":{"quantity":35.8,"unit":"%"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":60.5,"unit":"%"},"65 years and over":"3.7% (male 39,546/female 55,637) (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":{"quantity":21.3,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":21.1,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":21.5,"unit":"years"}},"Population growth rate":{"quantity":2.097,"unit":"%"},"Birth rate":{"quantity":24.56,"unit":"births/1,000 population"},"Death rate":{"quantity":3.58,"unit":"deaths/1,000 population"},"Net migration rate":{"quantity":0,"unit":"migrant(s)/1,000 population"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":{"quantity":72,"unit":"% of total population"},"rate of urbanization":{"quantity":3.3,"unit":"% annual rate of change"}},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":{"quantity":1.06,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"under 15 years":{"quantity":1.05,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"15-64 years":{"quantity":1.05,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"65 years and over":{"quantity":0.71,"unit":"male(s)/female"},"total population":{"quantity":1.04,"unit":"male(s)/female"}},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":{"quantity":14.92,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":16.73,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"},"female":{"quantity":13.01,"unit":"deaths/1,000 live births"}},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":{"quantity":75.01,"unit":"years"},"country comparison to the world":"","male":{"quantity":72.97,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":77.17,"unit":"years"}},"Total fertility rate":{"quantity":3.05,"unit":"children born/woman"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":"NA","HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":"NA","HIV/AIDS - deaths":"NA","Nationality":{"noun":"NA","adjective":"NA"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":{"quantity":92.4,"unit":"%"},"male":{"quantity":96.7,"unit":"%"},"female":{"quantity":88,"unit":"%"}},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":{"quantity":14,"unit":"years"},"male":{"quantity":13,"unit":"years"},"female":{"quantity":14,"unit":"years"}},"Education expenditures":"NA","ethnicGroups":["Palestinian Arab and other 83%","Jewish 17%"],"religions":["Muslim 75% (predominantly Sunni)","Jewish 17%","Christian and other 8%"],"languages":["Arabic","Hebrew (spoken by Israeli settlers and many Palestinians)","English (widely understood)"]},"government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"none","conventional short form":"West Bank"}},"economy":{"Economy - overview":"The West Bank - the larger of the two areas comprising the Palestinian territories - experienced a high single-digit economic growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid, the Palestinian Authority's (PA) implementation of economic and security reforms, and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by the Israeli Government. Nevertheless, overall standard-of-living measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second intifada in 2000. The almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of Israeli closure policies - a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the West Bank in response to Israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows, industrial capacity, and basic commerce, both external and internal. Since 2008, the PA under President Mahmoud ABBAS and Prime Minister Salam FAYYAD has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance, supported by more than $3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the PA's budget since 2007. An easing of some Israeli restrictions on West Bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities. The biggest impediments to economic improvements in the West Bank remain Palestinians' lack of access to land and resources in Israeli-controlled areas, import and export restrictions, and a high-cost capital structure. Absent robust private sector growth, the PA will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":12790000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":6641000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"services":"81% (includes Gaza Strip) (2008 est.)"},"Labor force":694000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":12,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":23,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":65,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":16.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":46,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1870000000},"expenditures":{"usd":3100000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.5,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":5.78,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":"$NA (31 December 2008)","Stock of broad money":{"usd":5567000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1800000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA (31 December 2009)","Industrial production growth rate":"NA%","Electricity - production":{"Electricity - production":{"quantity":500000000,"unit":"kWh"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":3265000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":2800000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":24000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":511,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":22150,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Exports":{"Exports":{"usd":529000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"Imports":{"usd":3772000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1040000000},"Exchange rates":"new Israeli shekels (ILS) per US dollar -","industries":["small-scale manufacturing, quarrying, textiles, soap, olive-wood carvings, and mother-of-pearl souvenirs"],"agricultureProducts":["olives","citrus fruit","vegetables","beef","dairy products"],"exportCommodities":["stone","olives","fruit","vegetables","limestone"],"importCommodities":["food","consumer goods","construction materials","petroleum","chemicals"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":"360,400 (includes Gaza Strip) (2010)","Telephones - mobile cellular":"2.405 million (includes Gaza Strip) (2010)","Telephone system":{"general assessment":"continuing political and economic instability has impeded significant liberalization of the telecommunications industry","domestic":"Israeli company BEZEK and the Palestinian company PALTEL are responsible for fixed line services;
