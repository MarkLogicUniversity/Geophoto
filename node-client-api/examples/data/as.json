{"code":"as","name":"Australia","region":"Australia-Oceania","background":"Aboriginal settlers arrived on the continent from Southeast Asia about 40,000 years before the first Europeans began exploration in the 17th century. No formal territorial claims were made until 1770, when Capt. James COOK took possession of the east coast in the name of Great Britain (all of Australia was claimed as British territory in 1829 with the creation of the colony of Western Australia). Six colonies were created in the late 18th and 19th centuries; they federated and became the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The new country took advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop agricultural and manufacturing industries and to make a major contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and II. In recent decades, Australia has transformed itself into an internationally competitive, advanced market economy. It boasted one of the OECD's fastest growing economies during the 1990s, a performance due in large part to economic reforms adopted in the 1980s. Long-term concerns include ageing of the population, pressure on infrastructure, and environmental issues such as frequent droughts.","geo":{"Location":"Oceania, continent between the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean","Geographic coordinates":{"S":{"deg":27,"min":0},"E":{"deg":133,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":7741,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":7682,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":58920,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than the US contiguous 48 states","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":25760,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin"},"Terrain":"mostly low plateau with deserts;

A series of major investments, such as the US$40 billion Gorgon Liquid Natural Gas project, will significantly expand the resources sector. Australia also has a large services sector and is a significant exporter of natural resources, energy, and food. Key tenets of Australia's trade policy include support for open trade and the successful culmination of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, particularly for agriculture and services. The Australian economy grew for 17 consecutive years before the global financial crisis. Subsequently, the Rudd government introduced a fiscal stimulus package worth over US$50 billion to offset the effect of the slowing world economy, while the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates to historic lows. These policies - and continued demand for commodities, especially from China - helped the Australian economy rebound after just one quarter of negative growth. The economy grew by 1.2% during 2009 - the best performance in the OECD - and by 3.3% in 2010. Unemployment, originally expected to reach 8-10%, peaked at 5.7% in late 2009 and fell to 5.1% in 2010. As a result of an improved economy, the budget deficit is expected to peak below 4.2% of GDP and the government could return to budget surpluses as early as 2015. Australia was one of the first advanced economies to raise interest rates, with seven rate hikes between October 2009 and November 2010. The GILLARD government is focused on raising Australia's economic productivity to ensure the sustainability of growth, and continues to manage the symbiotic, but sometimes tense, economic relationship with China. Australia is engaged in the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks and ongoing free trade agreement negotiations with China, Japan, and Korea.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":882400000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":1236000000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.7,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":24.8,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":71.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":11620000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":3.6,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":21.1,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":75,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":5.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":25.4,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":30.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":27.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":396100000000},"expenditures":{"usd":426500000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":22.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":2.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":6.02,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":347100000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":1134000000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1731000000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":1258000000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":3,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":239900000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":222000000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":589200,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":946300,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":311900,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":716700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":3318000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":42330000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":26590000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":22300000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":6560000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":3115000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-35.23 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":210700000000},"Imports":{"usd":200400000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":38620000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":1169000000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":329100000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":245900000000},"Exchange rates":"Australian dollars (AUD) per US dollar -","industries":["mining, industrial and transportation equipment, food processing, chemicals, steel"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","barley","sugarcane","fruits","cattle","sheep","poultry"],"exportCommodities":["coal","iron ore","gold","meat","wool","alumina","wheat","machinery and transport equipment"],"exportPartners":["China 21.81%","Japan 19.19%","South Korea 7.88%","India 7.51%","US 4.95%","UK 4.37%","NZ 4.1%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","computers and office machines","telecommunication equipment and parts","crude oil and petroleum products"],"importPartners":["China 17.94%","US 11.26%","Japan 8.36%","Thailand 5.81%","Singapore 5.54%","Germany 5.3%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":9020000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":24220000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"excellent domestic and international service","domestic":"domestic satellite system;
