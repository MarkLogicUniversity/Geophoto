{"code":"ro","name":"Romania","region":"Europe","background":"The principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia - for centuries under the suzerainty of the Turkish Ottoman Empire - secured their autonomy in 1856; they were de facto linked in 1859 and formally united in 1862 under the new name of Romania. The country gained recognition of its independence in 1878. It joined the Allied Powers in World War I and acquired new territories - most notably Transylvania - following the conflict. In 1940, Romania allied with the Axis powers and participated in the 1941 German invasion of the USSR. Three years later, overrun by the Soviets, Romania signed an armistice. The post-war Soviet occupation led to the formation of a Communist \"people's republic\" in 1947 and the abdication of the king. The decades-long rule of dictator Nicolae CEAUSESCU, who took power in 1965, and his Securitate police state became increasingly oppressive and draconian through the 1980s. CEAUSESCU was overthrown and executed in late 1989. Former Communists dominated the government until 1996 when they were swept from power. Romania joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007.","geo":{"Location":"Southeastern Europe, bordering the Black Sea, between Bulgaria and Ukraine","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":46,"min":0},"E":{"deg":25,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":238391,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":229891,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":8500,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Oregon","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":2508,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Bulgaria 608 km, Hungary 443 km, Moldova 450 km, Serbia 476 km, Ukraine (north) 362 km, Ukraine (east) 169 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":225,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"},"continental shelf":"200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation"},"Terrain":"central Transylvanian Basin is separated from the Moldavian Plateau on the east by the Eastern Carpathian Mountains and separated from the Walachian Plain on the south by the Transylvanian Alps","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Black Sea 0 m","highest point":"Moldoveanu 2,544 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":39.49,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":1.92,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":58.59,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":31570,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":42.3,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":299,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"earthquakes, most severe in south and southwest;

The country emerged in 2000 from a punishing three-year recession thanks to strong demand in EU export markets. Domestic consumption and investment have fueled strong GDP growth in recent years, but have led to large current account imbalances. Romania's macroeconomic gains have only recently started to spur creation of a middle class and address Romania's widespread poverty. Corruption and red tape continue to handicap its business environment. Inflation rose in 2007-08, driven in part by strong consumer demand and high wage growth, rising energy costs, a nation-wide drought affecting food prices, and a relaxation of fiscal discipline. Romania's GDP contracted markedly in the last quarter of 2008 as the country began to feel the effects of a global downturn in financial markets and trade, and GDP fell more than 7% in 2009, prompting Bucharest to seek a $26 billion emergency assistance package from the IMF, the EU, and other international lenders. Drastic austerity measures, as part of Romania's IMF-led agreement led to a further 1.9% GDP contraction in 2010. The economy is expected to return to positive growth in 2011.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":254200000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":161600000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-1.3% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":12.8,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":36,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":51.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":9350000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":29.7,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":23.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":47.1,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":8.2,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":25,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.2,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":20.8,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":32,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":21.1,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":50890000000},"expenditures":{"usd":62000000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":34.8,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":"NA%","Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":17.28,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":24390000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":63670000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":77460000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":30320000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":1.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":58280000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":49440000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":5169000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":921000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":117000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":214000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":115600,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":217000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":600000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":11420000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":16920000000.000002,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":5500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":63000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-7.934 billion (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":51910000000},"Imports":{"usd":59840000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":50510000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":108900000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":{"usd":80160000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":{"usd":1831000000},"Exchange rates":"lei (RON) per US dollar -","industries":["electric machinery and equipment, textiles and footwear, light machinery and auto assembly, mining, timber, construction materials, metallurgy, chemicals, food processing, petroleum refining"],"agricultureProducts":["wheat","corn","barley","sugar beets","sunflower seed","potatoes","grapes","eggs","sheep"],"exportCommodities":["machinery and equipment","textiles and footwear","metals and metal products","machinery and equipment","minerals and fuels","chemicals","agricultural products"],"exportPartners":["Germany 18.76%","Italy 15.42%","France 8.2%","Turkey 4.99%","Hungary 4.33%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and equipment","fuels and minerals","chemicals","textile and products","metals","agricultural products"],"importPartners":["Germany 17.3%","Italy 11.78%","Hungary 8.36%","France 6.14%","China 4.91%","Austria 4.75%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":5313000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":25377000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"the telecommunications sector is being expanded and modernized;
