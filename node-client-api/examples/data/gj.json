{"code":"gj","name":"Grenada","region":"Central America and Caribbean","background":"Carib Indians inhabited Grenada when COLUMBUS discovered the island in 1498, but it remained uncolonized for more than a century. The French settled Grenada in the 17th century, established sugar estates, and imported large numbers of African slaves. Britain took the island in 1762 and vigorously expanded sugar production. In the 19th century, cacao eventually surpassed sugar as the main export crop; in the 20th century, nutmeg became the leading export. In 1967, Britain gave Grenada autonomy over its internal affairs. Full independence was attained in 1974 making Grenada one of the smallest independent countries in the Western Hemisphere. Grenada was seized by a Marxist military council on 19 October 1983. Six days later the island was invaded by US forces and those of six other Caribbean nations, which quickly captured the ringleaders and their hundreds of Cuban advisers. Free elections were reinstituted the following year and have continued since that time. Hurricane Ivan struck Grenada in September of 2004 causing severe damage.","geo":{"Location":"Caribbean, island between the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, north of Trinidad and Tobago","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":12,"min":7},"W":{"deg":61,"min":40}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":344,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":344,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"twice the size of Washington, DC","Land boundaries":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":121,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"volcanic in origin with central mountains","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caribbean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Mount Saint Catherine 840 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":5.88,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":29.41,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":64.71,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":15,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":"NA","Natural hazards":"lies on edge of hurricane belt;

Hurricanes Ivan (2004) and Emily (2005) severely damaged the agricultural sector - particularly nutmeg and cocoa cultivation - which had been a key driver of economic growth. Grenada has rebounded from the devastating effects of the hurricanes but is now saddled with the debt burden from the rebuilding process. Public debt-to-GDP is nearly 110%, leaving the THOMAS administration limited room to engage in public investments and social spending. Strong performances in construction and manufacturing, together with the development of tourism and an offshore financial industry, have also contributed to growth in national output; however, economic growth was stagnant in 2010 after a sizeable contraction in 2009, because of the global economic slowdown's effects on tourism and remittances.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":1098000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":674000000},"GDP - real growth rate":"-1.4% (2010 est.)","GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":5.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":18,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":76.6,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":42300,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":24,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":14,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":62,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":12.5,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":32,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":175300000},"expenditures":{"usd":215900000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":3.7,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":6.5,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":11.06,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":123100000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":743500000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":658000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Electricity - production":{"quantity":178700000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":155700000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":3000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":1923,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-138 million (2007 est.)","Exports":{"usd":38000000},"Imports":{"usd":343000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":347000000},"Exchange rates":"East Caribbean dollars (XCD) per US dollar -","industries":["food and beverages, textiles, light assembly operations, tourism, construction"],"agricultureProducts":["bananas","cocoa","nutmeg","mace","citrus","avocados","root crops","sugarcane","corn","vegetables"],"exportCommodities":["bananas","cocoa","nutmeg","fruit and vegetables","clothing","mace"],"exportPartners":["Saint Lucia 19.73%","Antigua and Barbuda 13.41%","US 12.21%","Saint Kitts and Nevis 12.03%","Dominica 12%"],"importCommodities":["food","manufactured goods","machinery","chemicals","fuel"],"importPartners":["Trinidad and Tobago 39.76%","US 18.11%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":28600,"Telephones - mobile cellular":64000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"automatic, island-wide telephone system","domestic":"interisland VHF and UHF radiotelephone links","international":"country code - 1-473;
