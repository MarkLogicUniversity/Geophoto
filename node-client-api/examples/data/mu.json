{"code":"mu","name":"Oman","region":"Middle East","background":"The inhabitants of the area of Oman have long prospered on Indian Ocean trade. In the late 18th century, a newly established sultanate in Muscat signed the first in a series of friendship treaties with Britain. Over time, Oman's dependence on British political and military advisors increased, but it never became a British colony. In 1970, QABOOS bin Said Al-Said overthrew the restrictive rule of his father; he has ruled as sultan ever since. His extensive modernization program has opened the country to the outside world while preserving the longstanding close ties with the UK. Oman's moderate, independent foreign policy has sought to maintain good relations with all Middle Eastern countries. Inspired by the popular uprisings that swept the Middle East and North Africa in 2010-11, Omanis began staging marches and demonstrations - a small number of which turned violent in clashes with government security forces - to demand economic benefits, an end to corruption, and greater political rights. In February and March 2011, in response to protester demands, QABOOS reshuffled his cabinet, pledged to create more government jobs, and promised to implement economic and political reforms, such as granting legislative and regulatory powers to the Council of Oman.","geo":{"Location":"Middle East, bordering the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman, and Persian Gulf, between Yemen and UAE","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":21,"min":0},"E":{"deg":57,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":309500,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":309500,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":0,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Kansas","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1374,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Saudi Arabia 676 km, UAE 410 km, Yemen 288 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":2092,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":{"quantity":12,"unit":"nm"},"contiguous zone":{"quantity":24,"unit":"nm"},"exclusive economic zone":{"quantity":200,"unit":"nm"}},"Terrain":"central desert plain, rugged mountains in north and south","Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Arabian Sea 0 m","highest point":"Jabal Shams 2,980 m"},"Land use":{"arable land":{"quantity":0.12,"unit":"%"},"permanent crops":{"quantity":0.14,"unit":"%"},"other":{"quantity":99.74,"unit":"%"}},"Irrigated land":{"quantity":590,"unit":"sq km"},"Total renewable water resources":{"quantity":1,"unit":"cu km"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":{"quantity":1.36,"unit":"cu km/yr"},"per capita":{"quantity":529,"unit":"cu m/yr"}},"Natural hazards":"summer winds often raise large sandstorms and dust storms in interior;

Because of declining reserves, Muscat has actively pursued a development plan that focuses on diversification, industrialization, and privatization, with the objective of reducing the oil sector's contribution to GDP to 9% by 2020. Tourism and gas-based industries are key components of the government's diversification strategy. By using enhanced oil recovery techniques, Oman succeeded in increasing oil production, giving the country more time to diversify, and the increase in global oil prices throughout 2010 provides the government greater financial resources to invest in non-oil sectors.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":75840000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":55620000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":4.2,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":48.2,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":50.3,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":968800,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":"NA%","industry":"NA%","services":"NA%"},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":15,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":"NA%","Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"},"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":26.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":20500000000},"expenditures":{"usd":20100000000}},"Public debt":{"quantity":4.4,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":0.05,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":7.44,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":7257000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":22350000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":22050000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":17300000000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":4.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":13580000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":11360000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":816000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":84000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":593700,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":17290,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":5500000000,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":24000000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":13460000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":10890000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":350000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":849500000000,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":{"usd":2724000000},"Exports":{"usd":36120000000},"Imports":{"usd":19300000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":14000000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":8829000000},"Stock of direct foreign investment - at home":"$NA","Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad":"$NA","Exchange rates":"Omani rials (OMR) per US dollar -","industries":["crude oil production and refining, natural and liquefied natural gas (LNG) production","construction, cement, copper, steel, chemicals, optic fiber"],"agricultureProducts":["dates","limes","bananas","alfalfa","vegetables","camels","cattle","fish"],"exportCommodities":["petroleum","reexports","fish","metals","textiles"],"exportPartners":["China 26.98%","South Korea 17.19%","Japan 12.12%","UAE 11.23%","Thailand 7.64%"],"importCommodities":["machinery and transport equipment","manufactured goods","food","livestock","lubricants"],"importPartners":["UAE 22.9%","Japan 13.99%","US 6.46%","China 5.64%","India 5.27%","France 5.19%","South Korea 4.65%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":300100,"Telephones - mobile cellular":3971000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"modern system consisting of open-wire, microwave, and radiotelephone communication stations;
