{"code":"am","name":"Armenia","region":"Middle East","background":"Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally adopt Christianity (early 4th century). Despite periods of autonomy, over the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires including the Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Persian, and Ottoman. During World War I in the western portion of Armenia, Ottoman Turkey instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh practices that resulted in an estimated 1 million Armenian deaths. The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in 1828; this portion declared its independence in 1918, but was conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920. Armenian leaders remain preoccupied by the long conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated region, assigned to Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan began fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after both countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May 1994, when a cease-fire took hold, ethnic Armenian forces held not only Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant portion of Azerbaijan proper. The economies of both sides have been hurt by their inability to make substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution. Turkey closed the common border with Armenia in 1994 because of the Armenian separatists' control of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas, further hampering Armenian economic growth. In 2009, senior Armenian leaders began pursuing rapprochement with Turkey, aiming to secure an opening of the border; this process is currently dormant.","geo":{"Location":"Southwestern Asia, between Turkey (to the west) and Azerbaijan","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":40,"min":0},"E":{"deg":45,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":29743,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":28203,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":1540,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly smaller than Maryland","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":1254,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Azerbaijan-proper 566 km, Azerbaijan-Naxcivan exclave 221 km, Georgia 164 km, Iran 35 km, Turkey 268 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"Armenian Highland with mountains;

Sharp declines in the construction sector and workers' remittances, particularly from Russia, were the main reasons for the downturn. The economy began to recover in 2010 with nearly 5% growth. Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics, in exchange for raw materials and energy. Armenia has since switched to small-scale agriculture and away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. Armenia has managed to reduce poverty, slash inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia had made progress in implementing some economic reforms, including privatization, price reforms, and prudent fiscal policies, but geographic isolation, a narrow export base, and pervasive monopolies in important business sectors have made Armenia particularly vulnerable to the sharp deterioration in the global economy and the economic downturn in Russia. The conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s and Armenia's borders with Turkey remain closed. Armenia is particularly dependent on Russian commercial and governmental support and most key Armenian infrastructure is Russian-owned and/or managed, especially in the energy sector. The electricity distribution system was privatized in 2002 and bought by Russia's RAO-UES in 2005. Construction of a pipeline to deliver natural gas from Iran to Armenia was completed in December 2008, and gas deliveries are slated to expand due to the April 2010 completion of the Yerevan Thermal Power Plant. Armenia has some mineral deposits (copper, gold, bauxite). Pig iron, unwrought copper, and other nonferrous metals are Armenia's highest valued exports. Armenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid, remittances from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct investment. Armenia joined the WTO in January 2003. The government made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent years, but anti-corruption measures have been ineffective and the current economic downturn has led to a sharp drop in tax revenue and forced the government to accept large loan packages from Russia, the IMF, and other international financial institutions. Armenia will need to pursue additional economic reforms in order to regain economic growth and improve economic competitiveness and employment opportunities, especially given its economic isolation from two of its nearest neighbors, Turkey and Azerbaijan.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":16860000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":9389000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":2.6,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":22,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":46.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":31.4,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":1481000,"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":46.2,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":15.6,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":38.2,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":7.1,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":26.5,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":1.6,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":41.3,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":37,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":33.3,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":2063000000.0000002},"expenditures":{"usd":2607000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":6.9,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"Central bank discount rate":"NA% (31 December 2009)","country comparison to the world":""},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":{"quantity":18.76,"unit":"%"},"Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1131000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":3507000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1821000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"usd":140500000},"Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":8,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":5584000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":4776000000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":"451.3 million kWh;
