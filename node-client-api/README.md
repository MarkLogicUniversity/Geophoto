# MarkLogic Client API for node.js

The MarkLogic Client API for node.js provides access to the MarkLogic database
from node.js.

## Status

This branch provides the work in progress for the Early Access Release 3 of the  MarkLogic node.js API.

### Checked in for EA3

* quick path for simple JavaScript object CRUD and query
* values and tuples requests
* server-side transforms on query response summary and result documents in slice() clause
* snippets including custom snippets in slice() clause
* projection from result documents (extract)
* resource service CRUD and invocation for XQuery
* graph CRUD and SPARQL query
* specifying the database when creating a database client
* search suggest
* server-side eval

## Getting started

Please register at the MarkLogic Early Access website and then follow the tutorial instructions:

http://ea.marklogic.com/features/node-js-client-api/

The instructions describe:

* installing the MarkLogic database and setting up an admin user
* cloning this repository to set up the API
* working through some initial examples to get familiar with the API

For more detail about the API, use the documentation login from the Early Access to view
the reference documentation:

http://docs-ea.marklogic.com/jsdoc/index.html

After installing the dependencies including gulp, you can also build the documentation locally
from the root directory of the marklogic package:

    gulp doc

The documentation should be produced in the doc subdirectory.

### Example setup

To set up the REST users for the examples, execute the following
command in the root directory for the marklogic package:

    node etc/users-setup.js

Then, load the sample data:

    node examples/before-load.js

You can then execute any of the examples in the examples
subdirectory from the root directory for the marklogic package.

### Test setup and teardown

To set up the test database and REST server, execute the following
command in the root directory for the marklogic package:

    node etc/test-setup.js

To tear down the test database and REST server, execute

    node etc/test-teardown.js
